'''
question: 
indentation and index

could you please remove all the element in the even index in the following list?
and add all the rest of the number in the new list


hint: for instance the list is a =[1,2,3,4,5,6]

for i in range(0,6):
    if i % 2 != 0:   i is odd number
        new_list.append(a[i])
'''
a = [i for i in range(123,45678)]
