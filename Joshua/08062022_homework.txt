while factor is less than or equal to n do
if n is evenly divisible by factor then
 conclude that fator is a factor of n
 divide n by factor using floor division
 else increase factor by 1for example Enter a number 36 the prime factor of 36 are 2,2,3,3


2.could you please fetch out all of the number in the following listmy_str = '343my_limit43454my_limit45365my_limit45325423my_limit324351432my_limit5243523543my_limit653462564my_limit'


3. here give a string: {"A":1,"J":2,"S":3,"N":4,"H":5,"H":6,"F":7,"J":8,"X":9}
please make a function if input a key and print out the value
for instance: if the string is {'a':1,'b':2}, then you function should type 'a' print out 1 and type 'b' print 2


4.  could you do a code when you run your code if you input your name then print out hello <your name> else print "sorry i do not you"
