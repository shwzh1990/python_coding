Pakistan can benefit from the ‘New Silk Route’ if it can successfully improve its internal communications infrastructure and mend fences with all its neighbours, experts speaking at a seminar at the University of Karachi said here on Thursday.

Titled ‘Reinventing the Silk Route’, the event was organised by KU’s Department of International Relations.“It is imperative for the new government to improve Pakistan’s relations with its neighbours. Cooperate with your neighbours even if you don’t like them; open areas of cooperation”, observed Dr Christian Wagner, Head of the Asia Section, German Institute for International and Security Affairs, Berlin. He added that presently Pakistan did not enjoy cordial relations with three out of four of its neighbours.

Dr Wagner said that France and Germany overcame much bitterness to work together in the European Union, while adding that while the EU provides a framework for cooperation for all its members, the bloc does not meddle in internal or bilateral affairs of the states. He gave the examples of the religious conflict in Northern Ireland, as well as Basque separatism within Spain, commenting that the EU did not interfere in these issues.

The scholar added that territorial disputes also lingered between members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, yet these were not an impediment to regional integration.

Referring to relations between Pakistan and India, he was critical of the notion that all outstanding issues must be addressed before full normalisation of ties, instead suggesting that cooperation continue despite the deadlocks.

The German scholar felt that due to the instability in the AfPak region, Pakistan was facing issues convincing others it could provide a viable trade corridor. He said trade was good for consumers, but it cannot develop societies. “Trade is not an alternative to domestic reform”.

Commenting on the historic Silk Route that linked China and Europe, Dr Najam Abbas, Senior Fellow, East West Institute, UK, said that the Silk Route contributed to the development of civilisations in China, India, Persia, Arabia and Europe. Along with silk and other merchandise, ideas also travelled across this fabled route. He observed that from the time of the Chinese Han dynasty till the 13th century, the Silk Route “was among the world’s most important cross-border arteries”.

Coming to revitalising the Silk Route in the modern era, Dr Abbas said the route “could help Asia meet its full potential. Asia needs to enhance its economic integration process. Improved pan-Asian infrastructure is needed as well as capacity building of the region’s smaller economies”.

The scholar described the lack of region-wide connectivity in Asia as a “bottleneck” which resulted in “Asia’s huge economic potential remaining untapped”. He added that stability in Afghanistan was essential for the success of trade corridors running across this region.

Dr Abbas said that Afghanistan was a key node in the New Silk Route, and asked if the troubled country could become a “hub and transit point across the New Silk Route. Can it shift from an ‘arc of crisis’ to an ‘arc of opportunity’?”

Local analyst Saleem Aziz said Pakistan “is the fulcrum of the New Silk Road” while Dr Moonis Ahmar, professor of International Relations at KU, introduced the speakers and the topic.


 

 

Gwadar: on the cusp of greatness?

Gwadar now finds itself as a launching pad for big regional, if not global, ambitions based on the proposed Pak-China economic corridor.

Gwadar now finds itself as a launching pad for big regional, if not global, ambitions based on the proposed Pak-China economic corridor.

GWADAR: The Pearl Continental Gwadar, located on the hammerhead that defines this coastal town in southern Balochistan, is deserted on most days. Only a few of the hotel’s 114 rooms are being kept operational; instead of central air-conditioning, split ACs are in place; the shrubbery outside needs some attention. Cost-cutting measures are clearly in place.

And yet, the building is well lit and inviting, the smell of freshly polished furniture lingers in the corridors, at least some of the rooms that are still open are luxurious and well maintained, and the staff is eager to show you around.

After a cycle of boom and bust that has lasted nearly a decade, there’s an air of expectation in Gwadar, a feeling that good times are just around the corner, although that depends on whom you speak to.

This small town of 85,000 people in Gwadar district was a sleepy little fishing village until not so long ago. Now it finds itself as a launching pad for big regional, if not global, ambitions based on the proposed Pak-China economic corridor, a role reinforced by the prime minister’s high-powered visit here on Thursday accompanied by the chief minister and army chief.

The port is the centrepiece of the optimistic narrative. Its logo is a stylistic depiction of a lighthouse and a windsurfer with the words ”Symbol of prosperity“ underneath. In 2013, China Overseas Port Holding Company took over operations at the facility from the Port of Singapore Authority after the latter quit over a dispute regarding land to develop the port.

”Things are moving very fast,“ claimed Dostain Khan Jamaldini, chairman of the Gwadar Port Authority. ”Unlike Pakistanis, the Chinese spend a lot of time in planning, then they do the execution quickly.“

Reinforcing the impression of the feverish pace of activity, Director General Gwadar Development Authority, Dr Sajjad H. Baloch said, ”Several delegations of Chinese have visited within the last six months; that last one was here just a few days ago.“

Among the projects in the `Gwadar package’ are port expansion, construction of a new airport, an industrial estate, an export processing zone, desalination plant, water and sewage system for the city and transportation infrastructure such as a 19km expressway to link the port with the coastal highway, and other road and rail links connecting Gwadar to upcountry via Ratodero in Sindh.

It was recently announced that China would invest $1.8 billion in nine projects to develop the port and the city. In a way, China is picking up where it left off, for it had paid 75pc of the $248 million initial construction cost of the port.

The facility became operational in 2008, but on a very limited scale. For now, ships carrying subsidised wheat and urea from Canada and South Korea occasionally dock at the port for transfer via the coastal highway to Karachi and then elsewhere in the country. It’s an expensive exercise; direct transportation links from Gwadar to upcountry are crucial to make the port commercially viable.

And there’s the rub. Baloch insurgents are violently opposed to the port project, which they consider a means to further exploit Balochistan’s natural resources and render the local population a minority by bringing in labour from elsewhere.

Gwadar city itself is considered free of insurgent activity - mainly because only one road leads into this seaside locale, although it too has experienced its share of insurgent activity and enforced disappearances in the past.

However, step a little distance out on the M-8 that is to ultimately constitute one of the two vital road links to Ratodero (and beyond to Kashgar in China - the so-called `new Silk Road’) and the challenges begin to reveal themselves.

Every so often along the highway, also built by the Chinese several years ago, there are small lookout posts, which were manned by the Frontier Corps (FC) to provide security to the construction teams from attacks by insurgents. Bridges across en route river creeks, which flood in the rains, are unfinished. Work was abandoned when the security situation in Balochistan deteriorated rapidly after the killing of Nawab Bugti. Some Chinese contractors as well as labourers and FC personnel suffered casualties in attacks by Baloch militants.

The changing dynamics were reflected in Gwadar’s property market. A 1000 sq yard plot in the coveted Singhar housing scheme atop the hammerhead went from Rs50,000 in the ’90s to Rs5,500,000 in 2005 before plummeting to Rs300,000 where it languishes today. ”Many made a fortune from real estate here,“ said a local. ”But those who didn’t sell at the right time were ruined when the market collapsed.“

Now that the hype around the port is being built up again, it remains to be seen whether investors will return, especially in view of the worsening insurgency in much of the province.

There have also been some unsettling incidents around Gwadar city recently. In March, insurgents launched a well-planned attack on a radar post in Pasni, and in Jiwani, some non-Baloch settlers have been targeted by the militants.

Nevertheless, government officials and technocrats working on government projects insist the challenge is not insurmountable. The Awaran section of the M-8 highway, for example, has been dropped so as to skirt the volatile district. They also point to instances even now of portions of the M-8 in insurgency-hit Khuzdar being constructed under military supervision.

Speak to locals in the rundown alleys of the town though and they shrug their shoulders, pointing out that so far, the port has made no difference to their lives. Abdul Hakeem, a fisherman, says, ”All the change I’ve seen is that we’ve been moved from where we were living for generations to make way for the port.“

A 50-bed hospital constructed four years ago has still not opened due to shortage of medical personnel. Gwadar city uplift plans envisage its expansion to a 300-bed facility. ”The functional district hospital is in a shambles. It lacks basic medicines, and doesn’t have even a single dialysis machine,“ says a social activist. ”Are we to believe that things are suddenly going to improve for us?“

All considered, there’s much work to be done if the `prosperity’ narrative is to be one that takes everyone along.


 

 

The PM's  China  visit

The prime minister's recent visit to China yielded a rich harvest of agreements and contracts between the two sides. The bulk of these agreements centred on 'investment' by Chinese companies in energy projects in Pakistan. Not surprisingly, the government's PR team went into overdrive extolling how the agreements would be a "gamechanger" for the country.

Greater investment interest by China in Pakistan is indeed welcome and long overdue. The fact that out of a total of $101 billion outward FDI by China in 2013, only $90 million found its way into Pakistan is a reflection of how Pakistan has failed till now to leverage its unique and special relationship with its great northeastern neighbour. While bilateral trade volume has soared since the signing of the FTA between the two countries, with the deficit heavily skewed against Pakistan, a more meaningful engagement had failed to materialise.

This is as good a time as any for Pakistan to woo strategic investments by China. As amply demonstrated by the recent APEC summit hosted by China and the developments on its sidelines, China has been craftily using its economic powerhouse status and riches to project 'soft power' and increase its economic and political footprint from Africa to Asia.

This is as good a time as any for Pakistan to woo strategic investments by China.

The main planks of the Chinese strategy so far have been:

Strategic acquisition of natural resources, mainly in Africa

Liberal lending via trade and investment credits by China's ExIm Bank. (In fact, in the last two years alone, the Chinese ExIm Bank has lent $670bn more than the entire amount loaned by the US ExIm Bank in its entire existence).

Laying the groundwork for a new global as well as regional financial architecture to rival the West's hold of the Bretton Woods institutions. This includes setting up of the socalled BRICS Bank (the New Development Bank), the recently launched Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, and a separate planned initiative for a regional bank for members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

The creation of a renminbitrading bloc by the signing of currency swap agreements with a number of developing countries, including Pakistan.

The aggressive and heavily militaryfocused China containment strategy put together by President Obama is forcing the Chinese to ramp up their response. Regional connectivity initiatives and other projects under the 'New Silk Road' and 'Maritime Silk Road' framework are being speedily followed through. The ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor is also part of this strategic thinking.

Given both our failure to take full advantage of our bilateral relationship with China in nonsecurity areas, and China's imperative to counter a hamhanded US enterprise, the energising (quite literally!) of the PakistanChina relationship can only be welcome. In fact, we also need to guard against a concerted disinformation campaign against greater engagement with China that has already begun through various parts of the media.

That being said, it is perhaps even more important that any civilian agreements signed up to with China even commercial agreements with Chinese companies are subject to greater transparency and open to scrutiny. Full disclosure and transparency should have been the touchstones of the government's policy right from the start.

Unfortunately, that has not been the case, raising legitimate concerns about some aspects of the recently signed agreements. On the contrary, the government has compounded speculation about overpriced projects and underhand deals involving commissions and kickbacks, by its secretive and nontransparent handling of this initiative.

To counter the speculation and conjecture, the government should provide forthright answers to the following questions:

What is the exact size and nature of the investment component? The government's media handlers have done a successful job in portraying the agreements as Chinese "investment worth $45bn". The figure surely refers to the expected total cost of the projects planned to be undertaken. Typically for power projects, the debttoequity ratio is 80:20, meaning that, even if all projects materialise, the investment component at the most is not more than $9bn. The rest would be debt.

Which companies and who are involved in the projects? Will joint venture project companies be formed to execute and run the projects implying coinvestment by Pakistan and possible issuance of explicit sovereign guarantees or implicit budgetary backstops?

Is there any involvement of members of the prime minister's family, as is being suggested in some quarters? Any commercial or business interests would invariably involve if nothing else a conflict of interest which would be unethical at the very least.

However, the clear and present danger is that it could involve even more than 'just' a conflict of interest. If the prime minister's or chief minister Punjab's family is a beneficiary, then what privileges and state patronage will these companies receive that other companies competing for similar projects would not have access to? Are the financial returns 'padded' to accommodate kickbacks, cuts and commissions ie would the ultimate consumer or taxpayer in Pakistan pick up the tab for private profits for connected insiders?

These are not just abstract concerns expressed to taint the prime minister. Unfortunately, the prime minister is no stranger to allegations of involvement in megacorruption involving his two stints in power in the 1990s, and neither his nor any other government's example in the recent past inspires confidence of aboveboard and ethical standards of conduct being followed in large projects.

What process was followed for project identification and selection? Did the Planning Commission conduct studies and make recommendations, or, as in the case of the finalisation of projects to be included in the PSDP in June this year, did the son of the Punjab chief minister have the final say?

Finally, in the case of the new capacity that will be installed in the power sector, has anyone thought of how we will pay for it when we are only able to pay for a fraction of the current capacity?


 

 

'Security, political challenges in S. Asia need to be addressed'

Speakers at a conference on regional connectivity on Wednesday called for addressing security and political challenges in South Asia for integrating the world's least connected region.

Speaking at a daylong workshop on 'Regional Connectivity in South Asia' organised by the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS) in collaboration with German foundation, Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, the experts discussed various obstacles to integration in South Asia and noted that success of planned projects like Silk Route Economic Belt, New Silk Route, CASA1000 and TAPI depended on the security situation in the region.

The speakers were of the opinion that PakistanIndia rivalry was the biggest hurdle in the way of integration.

Listing the factors behind poor integration of South Asia, analyst Dr Riffat Hussain said it was a result of colonial legacy, PakistanIndia hostilities, Indiacentred power structure of the region, its geography, presence of nonstate actors and involvement of external powers. The situation, he contended, made the countries of the region look outwards for solution to their problems instead of finding solutions within the region.

He recommended conflict resolution, particularly that of Kashmir issue, as a way forward.

PakistanIndia rivalry termed biggest hurdle in the way of integration

Settlement of Kashmir, he said, was important for marginalising nonstate actors who are threatening regional peace.

"Until border disputes are resolved and regimes for regulating borders are in place, doubts and suspicions would linger on and regional connectivity would remain a pipe dream," he added.

Dr Hussain further proposed a regional mechanism for discussions on terrorism, adding that terrorism was a 'regional public bad' that did not serve anyone's interest.

Former foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed too blamed Pakistan and India's "legacy of mistrust, hatred and suspicion" for the situation, but said the country's leadership suffered from "bankruptcy of strategic vision".

He stressed that "corrupt methods and insensitivity" of political leadership and bureaucracy was behind poor progress of connectivity projects.

Ambassador Shamshad said it had been over a year that the government signed an MoU with China for the Economic Corridor, but still there was no structure for handling the mega project that was dubbed a gamechanger.

"Mindset at the top would have to change or else this project too would suffer," he said and recalled that Gwadar Port remained unoperational for eight years and the agreement on increasing trade wasn't able to meet the set targets.

Dr Ashfaq Hassan Khan, dean School of Social Sciences and Humanities, Nust, said peace and stability was critical for success of CASA1000, TAPI and New Silk Route (NSR).

He asked Afghanistan and its neighbours to take ownership of NSR, conceived by the US for regional cooperation in South and Central Asia, sustaining economic growth in Afghanistan and promoting trade and investment in the region, so that it could succeed.

"If the driver is pulling out then, who'll take care of it," he said about the future of NSR after the completion of US drawdown from Afghanistan.

The Silk Route Economic Belt (SREB) project, he said, in comparison (to NSR) looked more viable because of support from China that has made it the centrepiece of its economic diplomacy.

Speaking about the SREB, Fazlur Rehman, an analyst, said China would continue to invest in the project despite the security challenge.

"The Chinese thinking is that economic progress would address poverty and ultimately fundamentalism and extremism."

Mr Rehman, however, said security incidents could slow down the progress on SREB and economic corridor linking Gwadar to Kashgar.

Analyst Simbal Khan said political disputes played a more pronounced role in hindering connectivity in South Asia than in any other region.

She was of the opinion that domestic considerations of India and Afghanistan would have a stronger impact on the future of connectivity in the region.

Executive Director CISS retired ambassador Sarwar Naqvi concluded that Chinese commitment to the planned Economic Corridor coupled with determination and support of Pakistani government was cause for hope about the success of the project.

ANYONE who did not believe in Lady Luck or the goddess Lakshmi should have witnessed the Indian tea ceremony at Hyderabad House, New Delhi, on Jan 25. There was evidence enough and more that an invisible, indefinable force had lifted Barack Obama and Narendra Modi to such lofty eminence.

Think about it. Barack Obama a downandout first generation American who once slept roofless on a pavement in New York, whose friend was a drugsnorting Pakistani illegal alien, whose first fundraiser for a Senate seat was organised by his Pakistani friends in a Chicago restaurant (they raised $3,000).

Modi, initiated into politics while serving tea to RSS delegates, a pracharak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a married brahmachari vegetarian, an introvert and poet.

Yet, that day, in the garden of what Edwin Lutyens designed as the Nizam of Hyderabad's town house on Rajpath, Narendra Modi as the 15th prime minister of India served tea/coffee to Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States.

It was hardly the occasion for them to remind each other of their antecedents. So when Barack Obama referred to Modi's 'Bollywood'like reception by the Indian diaspora at Madison Square Gardens in September 2014, Modi had the ineffable grace not to mention that, less than 10 years earlier, just as he was on his way to address Indian expatriates at the very same venue, his US visa had been revoked peremptorily by the US government. It cited a forgotten piece of legislation, the International Religious Freedom Act passed by Congress in 1998.

The Indian press has made much of the ObamaModi chemistry.

And when both leaders announced "a breakthrough to end the logjam" over the USIndia nuclear deal (hanging fire since 2005 because of an obstructive unforgotten Indian law that enabled its operators to sue US suppliers in case of accident), neither fouled the atmosphere by alluding to Union Carbide or its culpability for the Bhopal tragedy in December 1984, in which 3,787 Indians died and over half a million Bhopalis were injured.

Official visits like Obama's are not sessions of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They are designed to be less about grimy substance than about nonlethal atmospherics.

Much has been made by the Indian media of the obvious chemistry between Obama and Modi the bearhug on arrival, the closely observed ttettes, the informal banter between the two. However spontaneous these gestures appeared before the cameras, they were the product of diplomacy aforethought.

This visit had a number of imperatives. The United States as a global superpower needed to reassert its interest in South Asia. By avoiding Pakistan, Obama wanted us to know that while USPakistan relations had yielded past uses, commerce with India promised future, greater benefits.

Modi, for his part, hoped that international economies would recognise that his India had turned its back irreversibly on Nehruvian socialism. Democracy and capitalism like Modi and Obama would stride forward together, handinhand. The unspoken expectation on India's part was the endorsement of itself as a selfappointed regional superpower, by a bully bigger than itself.

The attitude of leaders to each other can often make or mar such events. At Vienna in 1961, for example, John F. Kennedy felt patronised by Khrushchev's condescension towards him. Pandit Nehru never disguised even when they met his contempt for Gen Ayub Khan. And the personal animus between Indira Gandhi and Richard Nixon undoubtedly discoloured their policies during the East Pakistan/Bangladesh crisis in 1971.

"Politics," as Khrushchev once observed, "is a merciless business." Geopolitics is even less forgiving. During Modi's last visit to the US, he and Obama "expressed concern about rising tensions over maritime territorial disputes ... especially in the South China Sea". Because of the very nomenclature of those turbulent waters, China was bound to react. It warned both countries not to interfere in its disputes.

Unabashed, in New Delhi, Obama and Modi again reiterated the importance they attached to "safeguarding maritime security and ensuring freedom of navigation and over flight throughout the region, especially in the South China Sea".

President Xi Jinping's mature unrepentant response can be gleaned from a speech (termed "an Important Address") he gave to the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs, in November 2014. He stressed China's need to "promote neighbourhood diplomacy, turn China's neighbourhood areas into a community of common destiny and to actively advance the building of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21stcentury Maritime Silk Road".

If the United States thinks in centuries, China contemplates in millennia. Mao Zedong, sitting on Taishan mountain, declared famously once that "the East is Red". He was not simply describing the crimson sunrise. He was warning, as Zhou Enlai did Henry Kissinger in July 1971, that the US was "10,000 miles away. China was much closer".


 

 

Sound byte: 'Pak- China  ties as close as Beijing wants them to be'

"China's ties with Pakistan, which were established during Mao's rule and are based on shared hostility towards India, thrive on many common interests," argues Andrew Small in his forthcoming book The ChinaPakistan Axis: Asia's New Geopolitics.

In an exclusive chat with Dawn, Mr Small talks about the myth of a friendship that is higher than the highest mountains and describes how the balance of power in Asia is shifting after the recent ModiObama meeting.

Q: An oftheard cliche in Pakistan is that the PakistanChina friendship is an "allweather" relationship. Is that still true or is it a myth?

A: The cliches around ChinaPakistan friendship can sound overdone but that one is fairly accurate. It's a relationship that has been remarkably resilient over the decades, given the dramatic internal changes in both countries, and the shifts in the geostrategic context.

China may have very different needs now but it really has no other friends that it has been able to count on so consistently to look out for its interests.

And the original logic for the relationship persists Beijing wants to see a strong, capable Pakistan that can function as a counterbalance to India.

That doesn't mean that China will provide unequivocal backing to Pakistan during every crisis, or vast sums of financial support, but there's a deeprooted strategic alignment between the two sides that has never gone away.

The picture on other issues is more complex the economic relationship, even though it has left some large legacy projects behind, has underperformed for some time, largely due to political and security problems on the Pakistani side. And the counterterrorism picture is very mixed.

China relies on Pakistan to navigate the world of Islamic militancy on its behalf, help fix meetings and deals with various outfits to ensure that China isn't targeted, and crack down on Uighur militants.

But it has had doubts about whether Pakistan is handling this portfolio entirely effectively, and there have been some real tensions over these issues in recent years.

Q: Both China and Pakistan aren't the most popular countries in the world right now, in terms of human rights violations et al. Do you think that the Chinese leadership will, at any point in time, ask the government of Pakistan to do some serious soulsearching, or vice versa?

A: The two sides not only steer clear of that sort of thing but actively squash voices that try to raise these issues in public such as China's policy towards its Muslim population in Xinjiang. At times in the history of relations between the two sides, China has raised political concerns, but nowadays it's more likely to demand more forceful crackdowns than raise concerns.

We saw that with Lal Masjid and, a little more discreetly, in the runup to the North Waziristan campaign.

That remains very rare though ordinarily China is extremely careful about weighing in on domestic issues, unless they're tied to very direct Chinese interests, and it is still concerned not to alienate any political constituencies in Pakistan.

Q: Some say Pakistan is testing the limits of China's patience by dragging its feet on key projects, such as the Economic Corridor to the Gwadar seaport. Would you agree?

A: The original impetus for the economic corridor came far more from the Pakistani side than from China. Although Beijing values Pakistan's strategic economic geography to an extent, it is in no hurry, and it has other options.

In any case, even if Gwadar doesn't succeed as a serious commercial port, it still has potential utility to China as a naval facility in the longterm. In that respect Beijing has fewer options in terms of quasibases in countries that its military and intelligence services can invest trust in over time a point brought home by the recent elections in Sri Lanka but that could as readily be Karachi as Gwadar.

China does have its frustrations about the progress of many of the economic initiatives between the two sides, and would already have committed substantially more investment if there hadn't been such an array of problems executing projects after they were nominally agreed.

Beijing is now moving ahead with many of them despite its security concerns, and despite some political and commercial anxieties.

That's partly because it thinks that these investments especially in the energy sector are important to Pakistan's longterm stability; they're certainly not purely economically motivated. But the new leadership's commitment to its various Silk Road plans the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road are also an opportunity to give some new life to projects that might otherwise have continued to lag.

And the PMLN government has actually done a decent job of converting these Chinese grand strategic economic initiatives into action on the ground.

There are still big questions about how many of them will really take off, especially the most ambitious of the infrastructure connectivity plans, about which China still has many reservations.

But the two sides have also worked out a number of less grandiose projects that should still be realised even if railway lines to Kashgar are never built.

Q: Do you think recent ObamaModi meeting will have any effect on China's relationship with Pakistan?

A: In the past, China has certainly used its relationship with Pakistan to send signals to India and the US, and receiving a visit from the Pakistani chief of army staff on the day of Obama's trip to India was another example of that.

Beijing is willing to make symbolic counterplays when it thinks the USIndia relationship is growing too close the last two Chashma nuclear plants, for instance, only got the green light from China after the USIndia nuclear deal finally moved ahead.

Modi has been more forwardleaning on the US relationship than Beijing had anticipated, and Pakistan is always the place to turn when China wants to demonstrate that New Delhi still faces strategic constraints in its own region. We should see a little of that on show when Xi Jinping finally makes his trip to Pakistan.

Having said that, the momentum behind SinoPakistani security relations is there regardless of India's relationship with the United States the two militaries already collaborate extremely closely, and China has grown less defensive about how these ties are perceived.

With India and the United States alike, China expects that strategic competition can coexist with cooperation on economic matters and various global issues.

China would continue to deepen elements of its military cooperation with Pakistan even if USIndia ties were to worsen or if SinoIndian ties were to improve, as they actually have on trade and investment issues since Modi and Xi took office.

But there are also some natural limits there are formal defense commitments, for instance, that China is still cautious about making to Pakistan, and it would require a more dramatic set of developments for that calculus to change. For now, the ChinaPakistan relationship is as close as Beijing wants it to be.

The factors determining the geopolitical dynamics of our region have a name. It is Modi's concept of 'Act Asia' and Obama's idea of 'Pivot to Asia.' In fact, both the concepts emanate from their failed post 9/11 Afghanistan policies: The 2005 IndoUS Strategic Partnership was aimed at establishing Indian hegemony over the territories from Afghanistan to Bangladesh. For this purpose, Afghanistan was declared a part of South Asia, giving a free hand to India to use Afghan soil as the base for the "Coalition Spy network", against all the neighbors of Afghanistan, particularly Pakistan. Consensus was also reached on a civilian nuclear deal, and to get the deal, India voted against Iran's nuclear programme and agreed to jointly work with the US and its coalition partners, to contain and curb rising Islamic extremism in the region. The US and coalition partners failed on all counts.

Modi's present strategic embrace of the US adds new dimensions to the geopolitical dynamics of the region. Being a "nonaligned country, India is moving away from its encrusted ideology of nonalignment to a multialigned approach." India has now been drawn into a closer long term military relationship with the US in a swathe, extending from the Gulf of Eden to the Straits of Malacca. A defence framework agreement was renewed for ten years and the Defence Technology and Trade agreement was signed to help India build an aircraft carrier. India has also entered into the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation Forum, dominated by US and Japan and will be actively engaged "to counter Chinese New Silk Road Partnership, based on EuroAsian land bridge and the String of Pearls connectivity, stretching from the Middle East to China."

Modi's prime objective is to achieve "economic growth that could reach the poor, not by the pernicious limitations of the trickledown theory, but by a trickleup theory, in which swift financial empowerment of the poor is matched by the goods manufactured in India. Obama wants a piece of India's rising growth and a dominant role in Asia. US technology can help it along. Modi knows that." Therefore, India and the US now have set the goal of increasing trade from the present US$ 100 million to US$ 500 million a year, matching with that of China. A significant outcome of the visit is the breakthrough in finding the formula to remove the discord over India's nuclear liability laws.

Despite the strategic embrace with the US, India's policy of multialignment is pragmatic and far more practical and will continue to draw India towards China and Russia, exerting pressure on "America's ability to adjust to a multipolar world shaped by Delhi and Washington, although the rise of India is a geopolitical fact of our time and the manner in which it rises is critical to the future of the global order."

The geopolitical demands of Pakistan had made it a preferred American ally since the 1950s, the period of the cold war, and it got a bitter experience of the strategic embrace. Pakistan was used by the stronger partner when it suited them and was abandoned when not needed. The worst happened in 2001 when the American mindset demanded from Pakistan: "You are either with us or against us, forcing Pakistan to take the most immoral and illogical decisions to join America's war on Afghanistan, a brotherly and friendly country." As a consequence Pakistan suffered immensely and continues to suffer even now.

Recent developments are ominous for Pakistan, particularly at this point in time, when the political turmoil within and the war on our northwestern borders make the situation more complex. Yet there are some positive indications which demand very careful policy decisions and initiatives to mould these opportunities into assets. It is but logical to assume that the declared objective of IndoUS Strategic Partnership is to contain and curb the rising economic and military power of China, and "has set an alarm in China's mind, facilitating a defacto understanding between China, Pakistan and Russia, who have recently developed significant military and economic relations", strengthening Pakistan's external security dimensions. Moreover, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani recently declared at the Heart of Asia Conference in Beijing, that "the future of Afghanistan will be determined in a very inclusive manner and in close coordination with its six neighbors of the Inner Circle namely,

Pakistan, Iran, China, Russia and the Central Asian countries." He leaves India and the US out, whose post 1990 machinations had plunged Afghanistan into the civil war. The Afghans are now determined not to be cheated again and will take matters into their own hands, for a peaceful transfer of power and a peaceful border with Pakistan.

The present situation also offers the opportunity to Pakistan to construct a new narrative of the PakUS relationship, based on mutual self respect and interests, knowing the fact that, "the US isn't just another country. It is a super power that has made the world a more dangerous place. Where ever the US has recently intervened it has left a mess, worse than the earlier dictators did, as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria." It is therefore imperative for Pakistan to loosen the US bear hug, and opt for a more friendly and comfortable embrace, one in which to breathe freely.

Economic corridor: From prosperity to controversy

The muchtalkedabout ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), trumpeted as a harbinger of prosperity, particularly by ruling Pakistan Muslim LeagueNawaz (PMLN), has fallen victim to controversies as well as conspiracies with some politicians dubbing the project more contentious than Kalabagh Dam.

The corridor project running from Kashgar in Xinjiang province in China to Gwadar Port in Balochistan was signed between Beijing and Islamabad on May 22, 2013, aimed at focusing on linkages between western region of China and Pakistan.

It will connect East Asia, Central Asia and South Asia and benefit the whole region, according to a brief prepared jointly by Planning Commission of Pakistan and National Development Reform Commission of China.

Opposition political parties, particularly Awami National Party (ANP), accused the PMLN government of altering the original route that stretched from Gwadar to Zhob to DI Khan, touching neglected southern areas of KP like Kohat and Karak.

During a multiparty conference in Islamabad this month, ANP Chief Asfandyar Wali Khan who read a hurriedlywritten note, prepared by Senator Afrasiab Khattak, lambasted the government for secretly changing the route of the economic corridor, diverting its major portions to pass through Punjab at the cost of smaller provinces.

"Let me make it clear that if any alteration is made in the original route, we will make the project more controversial than Kalabagh Dam.

We are not against the venture, but against the move that only Punjab will reap its benefits," the ANP chief had told the gathering amid slogan, "No to alternate route".

When The Nation approached officials in the Planning Commission about what changes have exactly been made in the project, they declined to comment on the record, but the officials associated with the CPEC desk said the new routes were being designed to connect Lahore and other cities of Punjab before running through Hazara division.

Federal Planning and Reforms Minister Ahsan Iqbal did not reply to a question sent on his cell phone about any change in the route though he has reached out to leaders of political parties in an effort to take them into confidence on the corridor project and allay their concerns.

Federal Communications Minister Hakeem Baloch, however, told this reporter that he too had learnt from other sources about alteration in the original route, adding the controversy could convert into a wider conspiracy, shelving the project if concerns of political parties were not removed.

The minister, however, failed to throw light on the new route that would pass through cities in the Punjab, arguing that he had been unable to perform his ministerial assignments for two weeks on account of being busy with his family issues.

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Sheikh Aftab who also answers questions related to the Ministry of Communications on the floor of the house told The Nation that 90 percent of road infrastructure under the CPEC was being financed by China and only 10 percent was funded by Pakistan.

"I think China considers it feasible to construct the corridor along cities in the Punjab, but I am not sure about the exact map of the new route.

Political parties should not make the project disputed," the minister said.

But Senator Haji Adeel of ANP who claims he was the man who unearthed the alteration in the initial route told this reporter that China should intervene and pressurise Pakistani rulers to stick to the original route if it really wanted to achieve longterm objectives of the ancient Silk Route.

"We welcome the project but not at the cost of Pashtun and Baloch communities.

Any change in the original route will make the project more controversial than Kalabagh Dam as, unlike the proposed reservoir, the project involves large territories and much more people," Adeel added.

Not only politicians but nonpartisan experts believe that the corridor is of vital importance and vulnerable to multifaceted challenges and conspiracies, keeping in view the geopolitical location of Pakistan at a time when other regional players too want access to warm waters of the Indian Ocean.

"I think China, being an economic super power in the region, should make it sure that the corridor does not fall victim to controversies.

Beijing should make it sure that the route passes through neglected territories in Balochistan and KP," Professor Ijaz Khan of Department of International Relations (IR), University of Peshawar, told The Nation on Wednesday.

He suggested the corridor should be welcomed by all stakeholders in Pakistan.

He feared neglecting the downtrodden people and backward areas in Balochistan and KP would be a serious blow to the objectives of the corridor.

"If the route cannot pass through Peshawar, DI Khan and Pishin through Baloch territory to Gwadar, it cannot pass through Pakistan.

No further debate on it.

The KashgarGwadar route issue is very vital for the people of KP, Balochistan and the entire Pakistan.

It must touch their territories, otherwise the government must leave it," Dr Ijaz said.

According to Senator Afrasiab Khattak, CPEC is not the sole entry to landlocked Central Asian states, quoting a Chinese expert that the United States in 2012 officially pushed forward New Silk Road Plan which intended to take Afghanistan as its foothold for building infrastructure in order to connect Central Asia with South Asia.

Similarly, he said Chahbahar Port in Iran was another option to connect to Central Asia.

"But why should our government commit blunder by making changes in the original route? Let the corridor pass through the neglected areas as envisaged in the original feasibility report," Senator Khattak asserted.

By Chinas official account, its priorities and outlook (courtesy President Xi Jinping), internally and externally have changed so much over the past twelve months that it points towards establishing a new normal for the country, both in its domestic and foreign policies. Chinas economic governance and development strategy has shown different characteristics from being merely a crisis-coping strategy promoted several years ago to the present day one where decisions are taken keeping in mind Chinas ambition to now be seen as a responsible global economic leader. This is the reason that of late China has become more concerned about its economic trends than simple results, the inner strengths of its market than mere data movements, and with the results of its underlying reforms than simply relying on broad stimulus measures cum quantitative easing policies.

 The much feared report on the alarming situation on pollution in the large Chinese cities, especially Beijing and Shanghai, is now out and the numbers look much worse than originally thought. Had such a damaging report to China come out a few years back, the reaction would have been that of a western conspiracy, but todays Chinese leadership is instead seriously focused on all aspects of the report to determine what should be Chinas practical response to redress the present situation. The pollution is now so severe (in major cities) that its creating a political backlash by a rising middle class against the Chinese leadership for obvious reasons. As mentioned above, the challenges of pollution within China are not just limited to Beijing. The pollution in Shanghai is steadily getting worse. Expatriates working for multinational corporations are becoming increasingly less willing to live in these cities, even though their companies are offering progressively higher salaries to do so. Expats who do remain are, understandably, sending their families back home while themselves opting more and more for short stays.

Nouriel Roubini is one of most out-of-the-box thinkers as an economist. Remember, he was one of the very few who predicted the near-depression of 2008. He has recently written a neat little essay on China, which points that as the most populous nation on earth, and the worlds second-largest economy, China is increasingly becoming both a concern and an opportunity for investors. In the case of China, the goal of peaceful rise is to avoid the fate that has seized other emergent powers, such as the Empire of Japan during the Second World War, and Germany during World War I and World War II. So far, the reforms needed to achieve rebalancing have been postponed as President Xi is busy with consolidating his power, cracking down on corruption, and dealing with foreign policy and security issues. But the longer China kicks the can down the road and postpones reforms, the greater is the risk of a hard landing as bad assets, bad investments, and bad debts are mounting. Given that the dominant western powers, USA and Europe, and other large emergent economies of the world, India, Brazil and Russia, are grappling with revival initiatives in their own respective economies, the competition for global economic opportunities is only going to heat up in the coming days.

This means that we are likely to see a more assertive China in trying to safeguard its economic gains made over the last three decades. And this also means it would be looking to step out of the comfort zone of BRICS and strengthen its relationship with some of its old and dependable allies; Pakistan certainly being at the top of the list. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during his recent trip to China signed 19 agreements that add up to about US$ 42 billion investment in the next 3 to 5 years, about US$ 34 billion of it in the energy sector.

In engaging a changed China, it would be dangerous for the West to assume a posture of mechanical appeasement; deferring to too many of Chinas economic and diplomatic demands. The Chinese leadership, if it were to meet with such a permissive policy, might be inclined to stretch toward evermore territorial ambitions. So, the US and its new ally in Asia, mainly India, need to find a right balance between cooperation and competition with China and avoid both containment and entrapment. Finally, as the dominant economic power in the region and the largest funding source of projects like the Maritime Silk Road (MSR), Pak-China Economic Corridor, and most future South Asian regions developments, Beijing also faces difficult questions ahead - will China be able to keep domestic nationalism and its newfound confidence in check to resist dictating terms to regional countries and ignore existing international norms? Will China continue to value ASEAN as the driver of regional efforts? Can Beijing muster enough political will to address the MSRs strategic implications on regional security and the South China Sea dispute? And more importantly, in our context does China have the will to not only fit Pakistan in its larger Asian plans, but also the confidence in itself to be able to take us along without jeopardizing its other perceived economic interests in the South Asian region?

In the emerging domestic debate, Chinese scholars point out that with or without the MSR and with or without assuming a policemans role in South Asia, China will continue to strengthen its economic dominance and political influence both in Southeast Asia and South Asia. Therefore, ASEAN or SAARC or any country in its independent capacity should ask itself what role it can play in partnering China, rather than waiting passively for information and clarity from China. It should take initiative to help shape Chinas external policy and remind China of its existing multilateral and bilateral efforts in enhancing regional connectivity - Given its history with China, Pakistan as we know should have a strong case here! Yet, while China can justify its move to revive its ancient role in Southeast Asia and South Asia, there are many questions about its implementation that are waiting to be answered. The most pressing one and the most fundamental is whether Chinas ambition to regain global prominence is outstripping its capacity to execute the big ideas at home.

China on Thursday vowed to deepen maritime security, anti-terrorism, security and military cooperation with Pakistan.

Between India, Iran and Saudi Arabia, we need an outside ally.

The US has flaked on us countless times.

The Saudis fund only the wrong things and now with the crisis in Yemen they want our boots to be in the line of fire since they dont have much military experience.

We need China.

Why not? What else do we have going for us? We are in debt to Iran, over a pipeline project that we have no funds for.

Any deal with them opens us to international sanctions and Saudi ire.

Afghanistan could have been our link, but they really cant be trusted, and neither do they trust us.

China together with Pakistan is pushing for the construction of the Pakistan-China Economic Corridor within the construct of Chinas "Belt and Road" initiatives.

With the PML-Ns affinity for roads, this may well be possible.

We must be pragmatic now, and let it happen.

The corridor will link us to Central Asian trade, which we need for our gas and energy needs.

It will build our railways and road networks and make Gwadar a real international port.

The Punjab CM Shahbaz Sharif after one of his Beijing trips has stated that Pakistani development will have a ".

" Though the government is being optimistic, the touch will be heavier than expected, however, China is secular, it offers trade and infrastructure, and it balances India.

In the corridor, China gets economic expansion, more markets and Indian containment.

Imagine what this could mean for Kashmir when there are nearby Chinese roads at risk when India aggresses? The deals are sound from a security perspective and we already are the largest importer of Chinese arms in the world.

What has to be made sure of is that the economy benefits from trade.

We have core competencies in small and medium enterprises, cottage industries, cotton manufacture, and Pakistan has just secured a Chinese order for 1,500 tons rice.

There could be more orders.

We have to manipulate the situation so that we benefit, so that the does not turn into a Chinese invasion.

China is constructing the world economy. The focus is on shared destiny of all mankind. In this sense, Chinese President Xi Jinping came forward with an initiative called One Belt-One Road policy. It is a hallmark of President Xis policy. The idea was floated by him in 2013 during his visit to Kazakhstan and Premier Li Keqiang during his visit to Indonesia the same year also talked about this initiative.

On 28 March, Chinese National Development and Reform Commission , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Commerce unveiled the details of One Belt-One Road initiatives under which several corridors will be built to boost regional economies to the tune of US$2.5 trillion benefiting over 4.4 billion population across 65 countries.

The initiative is not simply building roads, rails, and ports but introduces a comprehensive network of infrastructure development. Asia Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) will finance projects built under this initiative. The BRICS New Development Bank, the Silk Road Fund, as well as China-ASEAN Interbank Association, and SCO Interbank Association will also offer funds.

China wishes that the United States, Europe, and Japan should join this initiative. Some anticipate that is a competitor to the US-led initiative called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). is not inclusive. It is open to all.

These corridors will be as under: The Maritime Silk Road will connect the Pacific coast to the Baltic Sea. The Silk Road Economic Belt will link China, Central Asia, Russia, and Europe, connecting China with the Persian Gulf, South East Asia and the Indian Ocean with Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan as starting points. The land Corridor between China-Mongolia-Russia will be built with Chinese province Heilongjiang as starting point. Starting from Kolkata, the China-India-Bangladesh-Myanmar Corridor will be built. The China-Central Asia-West Asia Corridor will be built with Xinjiang as a starting point. An exclusive China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will be built to connect Gwadar with Xinjiang.

After the Japanese miracle, the Han River miracle, the ASEAN miracle, and the Yellow River miracle, the Indus River miracle too will take place with Chinese support. The process has been started.

Pakistan is an important pillar of Chinas One Belt-One Road initiative. Chinese President Xi Jinping will pay a two-day visit to Pakistan in April. He will meet the President, Prime Minister, Army Chief, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, and leaders of political parties.

President Xi will formally inaugurate the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). President Xi was scheduled to visit Pakistan in September last but postponed the visit following sit-ins protests at Islamabad. The visit of President Xi has been taking place after nine years. Earlier, President Hu Jintao visited Pakistan in November 2006.

With regards to the CPEC, the groundbreaking ceremony will be kicked off by signing a number of agreements when President Xi arrives in Pakistan. As a number of Chinese workers will be deployed on projects in Pakistan, a special security force comprising 12,000 security personnel will be set up by Pakistan to prevent terrorist attacks stemming from the deteriorating security situation in the Middle East and internal law and order.

According to the IMF, Direction of Trade Statistics, Pakistan exports to China were recorded at US$ 2.9 billion in 2013, while imports from China were recorded US$ 12.1 billion for the same period, thus making the two-way trade to US$ 15 billion. China has become Pakistans largest trading partner. The increased level of bilateral trade is the result of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed in 2006 and operationalized in 2007. Trade stood around US$ 7.2 billion in 2007, which was just doubled in 2013. Bilateral trade was hardly recorded at US$ 1 billion in 2002. Under the CPEC trade volume would tremendously increase.

China used to be a shy away investor of Pakistans Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). However, it made a breakthrough in 2007 when its FDI increased to US$ 712 million, making it the third largest investor in Pakistan. In preceding years, Chinese FDI decreased once again and by investing US$ 700.3 million in 2014, China became the largest FDI partner of Pakistan. This is the result of CPEC initiatives and as Pakistans economic outlook was ranked positive by international rating agencies such as Poors and Standard, Moodys, and Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO).

China pledged US$ 46 billion under the CPEC during Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs visit to Beijing undertaken in November last. Both sides inked as many as 19 agreements. China also signed 14 agreements to build power plants in Pakistan to generate 10,400 MW electricity in Pakistan. Chinas largest hydropower company, Three Gorges, planned to sign agreements worth US$ 15 billion to construct nuclear power plants in Karachi. The company also built Pakistans first wind form at Jhimpir, Thatta. Pakistan also plans to import 4000 MW electricity from China. Pakistan is fast becoming an attractive place fetching Chinese investment. The visit of President Xi should be seen within this context of increasing economic and commercial interactions between the two countries.

A Chinese delegation on Wednesday met Federal Minister for Climate Change Mushahid Ullah Khan and briefed him about the progress regarding the 3,000-kilometer long Pak-China Economic Corridor (PCEC) project highlighting how important the corridor is for not only the economic growth of Pakistan and China but also the region.

The delegation was headed by China Council for International Investment Promotion Deputy Secretary General, Counsellor Yuan Jianmin.

The PCEP project, starting from Chinas western region of Xinjiang and to Gwadar, is the countrys biggest road project recently launched by the government.

Yuan Jianmin told the minister that PCEP will economically upgrade the bordering poor regions of both the countries by connecting Gwadar Port in southern Pakistan to Chinas north-western region of Xinjiang via highways, railways and pipelines to transport oil and gas.

He said that the idea of connecting different countries of this region economically with one common route was quite old. Different programs had been appearing by different regional players at different times.

Mushahid Ullah assured his all-out support for the actualization of the corridor project.

Both the sides also discussed at length various measures for increasing focus on regional economic integration, boosting the Sino-Pakistani friendship between the Karakoram Highway to promote and enhance trade between China and Pakistan and deepen all-round cooperation between China and Pakistan and to further consolidate and expand bilateral relations.

"Functioning of the corridor will open new vista of development prosperity as a result of which the national economy will grow fast, lead to creation of new job opportunities, poverty reduction, development of transportation sector and boost industrial growth," the minister opined.

Jianmin also told the minister, "Finally Chinese President Xi Jinping presented One Belt, One Road initiative, which was the establishment of New Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road to boost global peace and development through intensive physical and other forms of connectivity as well as cooperative ties between China and the countries across Eurasia, Africa and beyond."

Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives today (Monday) on a two-day state visit which is his first foreign visit this year and the first state visit by a Chinese President to Pakistan in nine years.

The main roads of the federal capital and all important state buildings, including the Parliament House and the PM House, have been decorated with lights and the flags of China and Pakistan.

A fleet of eight JF-17 Thunder jets will receive the President of Peoples Republic of China as his plane enters the Pakistani airspace and escort him to Islamabad airport. A 21-gun salute will be presented to the honorable guest on his landing at the airport.

President Xi Jinping will be received by PM Nawaz, President Mamnoon Hussain and the three services chiefs amongst other officials upon arrival.

President Xi Jinping will meet President Mamnoon Hussain to discuss matters of mutual cooperation whereas the guest will also hold official talks with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the services chiefs. A meeting will also be held today with politicians from almost all major parties.

President Xi will address the joint session of the parliament in Islamabad tomorrow to share his views over Pak-China friendship and other issues. He will be conferred the highest civil award Nishan-e-Pakistan. Security has been tightened in the federal capital.

Pakistan and China will sign a number of important agreements and MoUs regarding energy conservation, infrastructure development, economy and communication enhancement.

Meanwhile, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Sun Weidong in an interview with Media Sunday said Islamabad will get a big boost in efforts to meet its energy shortfall, improve infrastructure and set up industrial parks with the help of Beijing.

"No matter how the international and domestic situations changed, China-Pakistan relationship has always been moving forward," he said. He said the leadership of the two countries, apart from discussing all aspects of their multifaceted ties, would also focus on energy, transport infrastructure, agriculture, finance, tourism, poverty alleviation and cultural exchanges.

The ambassador described China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as an important part of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that would run through Asia, Europe and Africa. It would "be a driving force for common development in the region" he said and added that the main purpose was to achieve connectivity of policies, facilities, trade, financial services and people.

"The link would connect vibrant East Asia economic circle at one end and develop European economic circle at the other," he said and pointed out that it was not a solo initiative by China, "but a symphony performed by all relevant countries."

He was responding to a question whether he believed that the CPEC was a fate changer for Pakistan and the region.

The ambassador said the CPEC was now gradually entering into implementation stage and mentioned various projects already at different stages.

He said the first phase of Bahawalpur 100MW solar power project had been completed, while the second phase of 900MW solar project would be launched soon. Dawood 50MW and Sachal 50MW wind farms would have ground-breaking in near future, while agreement on transmission lines from Matiari to Lahore and Matiari to Faisalabad was expected to be signed soon.

Shahbaz Sharifs role lauded

During various meetings with Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif, heads of Chinese development agencies, investment companies, banks and financial institutions paid rich tributes to his services for giving a practical shape to mutual cooperation and promotion of Pak-China friendship. According to Chinese guests, the efforts of Shahbaz Sharif regarding investment in Punjab, announcement of economic corridor for Pakistan and making the visit of the Chinese President possible are commendable.

He said that China stuck to road of peaceful development aimed at bringing peace and prosperity to its neighbourhood through its development.

"China will not pursue hegemony and the old way of the big bullying the small. China will unswervingly pursue peaceful means in resolving disputes in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity."

The ambassador said that China was building new type of international relations - meant to replace confrontation with cooperation and replace exclusiveness with win-win cooperation.

"China rejects the practice of zero-sum game and the winner-takes-all approach."

Citing Chinas position on Afghanistan, he said it always supported Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process and looked forward to a unified, stable, developing and friendly Afghanistan.

The friendship that used to be described as higher than mountains, deeper than oceans, he said, was now called by the young Chinese as Iron Pak.

The ambassador said the two countries had supported each other in hard times.

He said the corridor was part of a wider one belt, one road strategy to develop Chinas western region and link the Silk Route Economic Belt with the 21st century Maritime Silk Route.

"The corridor comprises modern highway and railway transportation system linking Kashgar with Khunjerab in the north and onwards to Karachi and Gwadar in the south of Pakistan through multiple routes," he said, adding that the energy sector had been assigned top priority to help the country overcome energy shortages to achieve higher growth rates for speedy development.

"The corridor projects initially envisage $34bn investment in the energy sector and around $11bn in the infrastructure sector," the minister said, adding that the two countries had finalised plans to add 10,400MW through early harvest energy generation projects spread across the country to be completed by 2017-18.

Pakistan and China agreed on Monday to elevate their bilateral relationship to all weather strategic cooperative partnership that envisages strong defence and security ties, continued nuclear energy cooperation and expansion of trade.

The two sides also kicked off the implementation of $46 billion (A Ministry of Planning press release put the figure at $45bn) Pakistan-China Economic Corridor (PCEC), a combination of transport and energy projects, on the occasion of the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping who reached here on a two-day trip. He was accompanied by wife Peng Liyuan and a high-level delegation. The visit was hailed by both sides as historic.

The government rolled out the proverbial red carpet when the Chinese leader landed at Chaklala Airbase, where President Mamnoon Hussain and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, along with federal ministers and all services chiefs, received him.

Earlier, eight Pakistan Air Force JF-17 Thunder fighters escorted President Xis plane when it entered Pakistani airspace. A twenty-one gun salute was presented to the Chinese leader as he alighted from his plane. He was later presented a guard of honour by a contingent of armed forces and PAF jets did the fly past.

Mr Xis visit to Pakistan is his first overseas trip this year. He will later visit Indonesia to attend the Asian-African Summit and events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Bandung Conference before returning to China on Friday.

President Xi opened his trip with a meeting with Prime Minister Sharif and later signed off agreements worth $28bn, in addition to inaugurating and performing ground-breaking of many other projects by unveiling plaques a ceremony performed at the Prime Ministers Office.

A statement issued by the Foreign Office said: "The leaders ... agreed to elevate the Pakistan-China relationship to the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, enriching the Pakistan-China community of shared destiny, to ensure the perpetual continuity in Pakistan-China friendship from generation to generation."

Both sides emphasised each others importance in their foreign policy calculi and noted the "strategic significance" of their ties in the context of the evolving regional and global situation.

Pakistani side termed relations with China "cornerstone of its foreign policy", while Beijing said Islamabad enjoyed a priority on its foreign policy agenda.

After the talks, Prime Minister Sharif told the media that he along with President Xi had taken "momentous decisions" that would take bilateral ties to new heights and "have deep and far-reaching impact for our common economic future and peace and stability in the region".

About the agreements signed during Mr Xis visit, Mr Sharif said: "They have sound financial and technical backing and are being put on a fast track. We are starting a fresh phase in our geo-economic partnership that will create new jobs, start businesses, promote education and professional training and help eradicate poverty. This corridor will become a symbol for peace and prosperity."

Both countries have been attaching a lot of importance to the economic corridor, a flagship project that is part of the Belt and Road aims at promoting regional connectivity, besides increasing cooperation between the two countries in the field of energy, infrastructure, transport and industry.

"The two sides believed that the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiatives represent a new model of regional and South-South cooperation, which will offer new opportunities for Asias rejuvenation and the common prosperity of all countries," a joint statement on the visit said.

Continued N-energy cooperation envisaged; leaders of opposition parties meet Chinese leader

And while the FO statement and Mr Sharif in his remarks emphasised that the PCEC would benefit "all regions and entire population", it was only Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif who had been invited to the ceremony to welcome the Chinese leader.

A Silk Road Fund has been created to fund corridor projects. Karot hydropower was the first project picked for investment by the fund.

TRADE: The two sides committed to increasing their bilateral trade to $20 billion over the next three years and expedite discussions on a free trade agreement. The current level of trade has crossed $15bn.

"The two sides decided to speed up the second round of talks on the Pakistan-China free trade agreement and are ready to open up the banking industry wider to each other under the Pakistan-China agreement on trade in services," the joint statement said.

DEFENCE COOPERATION: Pakistan and China agreed to strengthen their already close defence ties. The two sides pledged to "deepen cooperation in areas such as joint exercises and training, personnel training and equipment and technology, and expand cooperation in defence technology and production," the joint statement said.

Mr Xi met Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Rashad Mehmood, Army Chief Gen Raheel Sharif, Navy Chief Admiral Muhammad Zakaullah and Air Chief Air Chief Marshal Sohail Aman.

NUCLEAR ENERGY: In another important agreement, Islamabad and Beijing agreed to continue their cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.

"They agree to continue bilateral cooperation in civil nuclear energy under IAEA safeguards, in line with their respective bilateral and multilateral commitments," the statement said.

China has assisted Pakistan in building six nuclear reactors with a total installed capacity of 3.4 million kilowatts. The upcoming 2200MW nuclear power plants - K-2 and K-3 - in Karachi are also being set up with Chinese assistance. Pakistan has set the target of generating 8800MW from nuclear power and has been eyeing Chinese cooperation.

China, according to the statement, praised Pakistans move towards mainstreaming into the global non-proliferation regime and its engagement with the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

China said it was "ready to strengthen communication and coordination with Pakistan" in the field of non-proliferation and civilian nuclear programme.

SECURITY COOPERATION: Noting that their security interests were inter-connected, Pakistan and China vowed to continue to work together to fight the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, a terrorist group active in Chinas Xinjiang province but also has bases in Pakistans tribal areas.

"China commended Pakistans major contribution to the international counter-terrorism efforts, and will continue to support Pakistan in implementing its counter-terrorism strategy in accordance with its national conditions and enhancing counter-terrorism capacity building," the joint statement said.

The two sides said they would collaborate in promoting the concept of common Asian security and seek to expand their bilateral security cooperation under the rubric of their strategic dialogue and counter-terrorism consultations.

SPACE and MARITIME: There were also agreements on cooperation in space technology applications and maritime research.

"Both sides agreed to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in space technology applications, expedite the integration process of remote sensing, telecommunication and navigation technologies for their extensive application in communications, hydrology, geology, disaster management, port management, mineral prospection, food security, water prospection and other areas for seeking potential advantage in social and economic development," the statement said.

Both sides agreed to fully leverage the Pakistan-China maritime cooperation dialogue mechanism and strengthen policy dialogue and strategic communication on maritime issues for increased cooperation on navigation security, marine economy, exploration and utilisation of marine resources, marine scientific research and environmental protection.

There was also an agreement on establishment of a Joint Marine Scientific Research Centre in Pakistan and holding training course for South Asian countries on maritime scientific research.

Khawar Ghumman adds on meeting with political leadership: It wasnt only the countrys entire civilian and military leadership that in an unprecedented show received the Chinese president at the airport, politicians from opposition political parties also stood in line, albeit at a different venue, to shake hands with the visiting dignitary.

PPP Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari, PTI Chairman Imran Khan, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehamn, JI General Secretary Liaquat Baloch, PML-Q President Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, Qaumi Watan Party chief Aftab Sherpao, MQM leader Dr Farooq Sattar were shown on national television walking up to the Chinese president one by one to shake hands and have a brief chat.

They also attended the banquet hosted by Prime Minister Sharif at the PM House.

Compared to the $46 billion China plans to invest in Pakistan, the $7.5 billion US package for Pakistan was too thinly scattered, according to a former Pentagon official.

David S. Sedney, who headed the Pakistan desk at the Pentagon, said the US package also failed to make a strategic impact on Pakistan.

Some Western diplomats told CBS News that Chinas increasing economic engagement with Pakistan should be seen in the context of Beijings "efforts to counter the US efforts to deepen alliances around the Asia-Pacific region".

Read: Economic corridor in focus as Pakistan, China sign 51 MoUs

In an interview to The New York Times, Mr Sedney noted that the 2009-2012 US aid package for Pakistan designated $7.5 billion for development projects over five years. He called the package a "dramatic failure" because the resources were "scattered too thinly, and had no practical or strategic impact.

The official noted that the Chinese seemed to have learned from the American programme, "including the notion that the American plan was designed to deliver a strategic result - deterring terrorism -- but failed to do so".

To do better than the United States, the Chinese have come up with "a much larger financial commitment -- and it is focused on a specific area, it has a signature infrastructure focus and it is a decades-long commitment," he said.

Other US media outlets pointed out that China would use this massive investment package to expand Pakistans network of roads, rails and ports. The purpose of the initiative was to connect China to Europe through Central Asia and Russia, the reports said.

The reports noted that in November, China announced plans to build the Silk Road Economic Belt and Maritime Silk Road, which would connect Pakistan to China and Central Asia.

Pakistani officials told The New York Times Chinas $46 billion would be used for the construction of roads, rails and power plants. Chinese engineers will be dispatched over 15 years to work in Pakistan in projects that overshadow past US support.

The newspaper also spoke to senior Pakistani officials and politicians who pointed out that "the Chinese are stepping in, in a much, much bigger way than the United States ever contemplated.


 

 

PM tries to allay corridor concerns

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif attempted on Tuesday to allay the concerns of some quarters over the route of the Pakistan-China Economic Corridor (PCEC), saying the wide-ranging cooperation between the two countries was going to benefit all regions of the country.

Addressing the joint sitting of parliament, the PM said: "This is a catalytic project that will help us to combine the geo-strategic and geo-economic streams of our relationship. It will benefit the entire country and all the provinces Balochistan, Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir."

The remarks came as he thanked the Chinese president before the latters address to parliament.

According to government sources, it was important to emphasise this point in the presence of the countrys entire political leadership.

The PM also made use of the occasion to impress upon the visiting Chinese president how the countrys political leadership was on the same page when it came to the time-tested friendship between the two countries.

"As you can see, leaders and representatives of all the political parties are here to welcome you. All political parties in Pakistan have one united stance: Pakistan should have a robust bond with China. This is also the aspiration of the constituents they represent and, in fact, the entire nation of Pakistan."

On Monday, a number of opposition members in the National Assembly had asked the government benches to provide them details of the PCEC route. In February, a conference of political parties organised by the Awami National Party in Islamabad vowed to resist the federal governments reported plan to change the PCEC route.

The forum went as far as to warn the federation of "serious consequences" if the PML-N government insisted on excluding areas of KP and Balochistan from the economic corridor.

Last month, Balochistan Chief Minister Dr Abdul Malik, speaking on the floor of the provincial assembly that had passed a resolution against alleged attempts to alter the PCEC route, said he would "take up the issue with the federal government".

Although the government has yet to announce the final route, Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal, in a recent media interaction, clarified that it wasnt just one route, but a network of multiple roads from Gwadar to Khunjerab.

One of the routes goes through Gwadar-Quetta-Killa Saifullah-Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan-Peshawar.

Assures President Xi of Pakistans support for Chinas defence and foreign policies

The second route will be Gwadar-Ratodero-Sukkur and the Indus Highway. The third route will be Gwadar-Sukkur and the Karachi to Peshawar motorway, the minister explained.

Economist Dr Kaiser Bengali, who advises the Balochistan CM, told Dawn: "The best way to address the concerns of the relevant quarters is that the government formally presents the PCEC route before the two houses of parliament."

In his remarks, the PM also supported Chinas defence and foreign policies. "Let me assure you Mr president, Pakistan considers Chinas security as its own security. We would fight together to eliminate the menace of terrorism.

"Our joint efforts in this regard have succeeded but we need to intensify these efforts to accomplish our objective. In the international forums, Pakistan will continue to support One-China Policy and Chinas stand on its core national interests."

The PM also spoke highly of the Chinese presidents "one belt, one road" vision. "We applaud your vision of Community of Shared Destiny, underpinned by One Belt, One Road.

"This vision is anchored in the strong desire of the continents of Asia, Africa and Europe to cement their common bonds for a better future."


 

 

 China  raises the stakes

Now that President Xi Jinping has concluded his visit to Pakistan, leaving behind him much optimism, it is time to reflect on the meaning of the event.

For a country that has been the favourite punching bag of the international community for almost a decade now, a visit from the head of an emerging great power who shared words of warmth and friendship has been a breath of fresh air.

In the days to come, many will hype up the importance of the visit, while others will try to puncture the optimism with their cynicism. At this early point, there are two things to note regarding the visit, and the message that President Xi brought with him to Pakistan.

Read: Pakistan was with us when China stood isolated: Xi Jinping

First, the view that China takes of South Asia was revealed in his speech to parliament. He urged Pakistan to play a more proactive role in bringing about reconciliation between the government and the warring factions in Afghanistan. He also pledged cooperation in the fight against "non-traditional actors".

And he avoided any mention of Pakistans territorial disputes with India, preferring to speak of the latter only as an addition to the economic corridor that he is proposing, which could extend eastward through India to Myanmar and beyond.

In Chinas view, peace and stability in South Asia are more important than rivalry and conflict, and President Xis speech to parliament made it clear he believes Pakistan holds the key to this.

This is a hopeful sign. In the past, other countries, most notably the United States, have said the same thing, urging Pakistan to renounce support for "non-traditional actors" as an instrument of foreign policy, and to find peaceful ways to address its territorial disputes to the east, as well as its fears of encirclement from the west.

But the US was hobbled by the baggage of the past, having played its part in nurturing these very same "non-traditional actors" during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, then walking away from the conflict once its own objectives were achieved. It also served as an erratic and somewhat hapless broker in its attempts to nudge India and Pakistan along the path of dialogue.

But China has no such baggage. It commands credibility amongst the leadership as well as the populations of all countries in the region; and now that they are willing to own the same message of peace and stability in South Asia, there is hope that the message might actually find receptive ears.

Needless to say, much depends on whether or not this happens.

The second thing to note is the theme that ran through the speech. Pakistan has been an enduring friend to China, he said.

And in return, China now wishes to include Pakistan in its larger regional plans titled One Belt, One Road, where Pakistan can serve as a bridge between the New Silk Road for Eurasian connectivity, and a Maritime Silk Road between the ASEAN countries.

If properly executed, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor could prove a transformative vision that can be the driver of Pakistans growth rates for decades to come. Again, much depends on whether the opportunity is properly understood.

The invocations of enduring friendship are music to the ears of a country accustomed to being vilified globally for so many years now.

But it is important to note that President Xi opens almost every speech in every country with similar invocations.

His style of diplomacy is to make everyone he addresses believe they are special. It would be a mistake to understand this to mean that there is no obligation on our part. The One Belt, One Road vision has more than 60 countries participating.

But nothing is assured, nor is Pakistan the only country that can serve as a bridge. To successfully become part of this initiative, Pakistan will have to live up to its side of the bargain, which includes doing its bit to promote stability in the region and creating the right economic environment for the promised investment to operate in.

The words President Xi had for us were heartening but will only be meaningful if we can match them with deeds on our side. That is where the question marks now linger.

Assuring Islamabad of standing with it through thick and thin, Chinese President Xi Jinping was all praise to the people and the government of Pakistan for rendering matchless sacrifices being a frontline state against terrorism, and expressed the hope that Pakistan has the economic capability to transform into an Asian Tiger.

Addressing joint session of the parliament, President Xi said, strong relations with Pakistan will remain top priority of Chinas diplomatic agenda. Regardless of changes at the international level, China will continue to see Pakistan in strategic and long-term perspective, he told lawmakers amid repeated desk-thumping.

The Chinese president, on the second day of his two-day state visit, thanked the Pakistani parliamentarians for having him in the session and showed his ecstasy for addressing the huge gathering. Lauding the people of Pakistan, he stated that Pakistanis are kind, brave, dignified, confident and patriotic. He said the Economic Corridor project will benefit not only the region but also every citizen of Pakistan. In the next five years, China would provide several training opportunities to Pakistanis, he added.

Pakistan is Chinas friend, brother and neighbour, Xi remarked. He said Pak-China friendship is a heritage for the future generations. He said Shahra-e-Karakoram is a bond between two civilisations. Quoting the national poet of Pakistan, Xi Jinping said that Poet of the East Allama Muhammad Iqbal had said in 1930 that China would appear to be one of the greatest powers in the world.

The Chinese president assured to help Pakistan in initiating developmental projects in Fata. He said no one can destroy the "sincere friendship of Pakistan and China" as both states have promised to respect the policies of each other rather than criticising the acts. About Pakistans economic efforts, he said the country has made a rapid economic progress.

He announced his country firmly supports Pakistans commitment to uphold its sovereignty, territorial integrity and national dignity. About his visit to Pakistan, Xi Jinping said he chose Pakistan as the first country to visit this year which reflects "our deep-rooted love and affection besides our desire to give new impetus to our relations".

About Pakistans sacrifices in the war on terror, President Xi said that the sacrifices of the people of Pakistan rendered while combating terrorism will be remembered. "We will always support Pakistans struggles for the peace in the region. I remember the time when China was all alone in the world and Pakistan supported us," the president remarked. He also remarked that Pakistan is one of the first countries which recognised China and it was the first Islamic country to develop diplomatic relations with Beijing.

"Over the years Pakistan has overcome all kinds of difficulties and contributed greatly to the security and stability of Chinas western border areas and this is something that we shall never forget," Xi told the parliament in what was interpreted by some news agencies as a reference to help in curbing insurgency relating to Xinjiang.

"Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries have made concerted efforts to forge strong relations and pursue development. We have always supported each other on core issues. Such a friendship is truly unique". Xi also said both countries have always come forward with selfless and valuable assistance to each other in difficult times.

Giving a future roadmap for a more robust strategic partnership, the Chinese leader said both the countries need to work together to strengthen their friendship and economic relations. "We should continue to support each other on core issues and remain each others dependable partners," he said, adding groups of 100 youth from each country should also visit the other to strengthen people-to-people contact. He announced his country will provide training to 2,000 Pakistani youth in diverse fields in the next five years. As many as 1,000 teaching staff will also be trained in Chinese language, he added.

Xi said both the countries should maintain strategic communication on regional and international issues. "Both countries share common threats and they should stick together to confront them." He said China supports Pakistans constructive role in Afghanistan. President Xi said China is a peace-loving country and it wants to promote relations with all the South Asian countries. "We will open in all respects in order to build an open economy. The Silk Route project is a significant move on part of China to fully open up," he added.

Later, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, in a vote of thanks, said Pakistan considers Chinas security as its own security. "We will fight together to eliminate terrorism. Our joint efforts in this regard have succeeded but we need to intensify these efforts." Pakistan would continue to support One-China Policy and Chinas stand on its core national interests, Nawaz said. "We appreciate Chinas solidarity with Pakistan in our quest for peace and stability in South Asia," he noted.

The premier further said they applaud Chinese vision of Community of Shared Destiny, underpinned by "One Belt, One Road". This vision is anchored in the strong desire of the continents of Asia, Africa and Europe to cement their common bonds, he said. "Pakistan-China Economic Corridor is a product of our joint endeavours at the conceptual and operational levels... It has moved fast into the implementation phase," he said, adding this is a catalytic project that will help both states combine the geostrategic and geo-economic streams of bilateral relationship.

Nawaz Sharif was hopeful it would benefit the entire country. "The Corridor will stimulate completion of the projects in the areas of transportation infrastructure, energy and industrial development," he said, and paid thanks to the Chinese leadership, state institutions, banks and corporations for supporting all these projects. About energy crisis, the PM said Pakistan pays thanks for Chinas commitment to help resolve the energy crisis and make it self-sufficient in energy.

The prime minister said Pak-China defence ties are strong and poised to become stronger. "This year is the year of friendly exchanges. Let the youth of the two countries inherit this unique relationship that we have developed over the decades and take it to new heights," he said, and hoped that both countries general public and professionals would sustain friendship and make it even more productive.

"Your visit and your address are historic, as we look at our relationship over the next 15 years and beyond. I appreciate all members of your delegation for their diligent preparation," he said. Chinese Presidents visit had not only galvanised the people of China but also inspired the people of Pakistan, he said. Quoting Confucius on friendship, he said China is not a friend from afar but one who is so close to our heart.

Opposition Leader Khursheed Shah, in his welcoming address from opposition side, said that Chinese Presidents visit would further strengthen bilateral ties and contribute a lot to the prosperity of the two nations. "Both nations are keen and active to further develop cooperation in every field of life," said Shah, adding both countries have attained many milestones in their bilateral ties. "I hope this friendship rooted in the hearts and minds of the people will continue to grow forever," he remarked.

The PPP under the visionary leadership of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto laid the foundations of strong relationship with China, Shah said. Through his vision, Bhutto made this relationship as an essential and never changing pillar of the foreign policy of Pakistan, he said, adding that Benazir continued the legacy of her father which was further cemented by former Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari.

National Assembly Speaker Iyaz Sadiq in his speech said it is historic as its the first address by any foreign dignitary to the present Parliament while President Xi is the fourth Chinese leader to address Pakistani parliament in the history of the country. He said these landmarks reflect the deep bonds, which have continued to prosper between the two great nations for over six decades. "Its a brothers homecoming. Its a reunion of one big family. Its a keenly awaited visit by a friend indeed!" he remarked. He said the House notes with great satisfaction that the successive leaderships of the two countries have diligently worked to translate the Sino-Pak relations into meaningful cooperation.

The joint session of parliament was also attended by the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, the three services chiefs, governors, chief ministers and diplomats from various countries. PM Nawaz Sharifs wife Begum Kulsoom Nawaz and the First Lady of China were also in the guest gallery. Interior Minister Ch Nisar Ali, who was otherwise not in the picture of Xis visit, did attend the joint session but was seemingly in low key.

THE recent visit of Chinas President Xi Jinping was a much-needed shot in the arm for Pakistans people. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor enterprise confirms Chinas strategic partnership with Pakistan. While it will advance Chinas plans for the New Silk Road, this will be a "game changer" for Pakistan, as one minister put it.

Unfortunately, there is many a slip between . Pakistan has missed several opportunities in the past to exploit strategic developments as a platform to build a robust economy and a stable polity. Many in the West have wasted no time in expressing scepticism regarding the success of this corridor project. Their ennui is understandable.

Yet, there is no reason why Pakistan and China should not be able to realise the ambitious vision outlined during Xi Jinpings historic visit.

There is no reason why we should not realise the ambitious vision outlined during President Xis visit.

There are actually two kinds of projects to be implemented under the economic corridor: government-to-government infrastructure projects (Gwadar Port, KKR highway, road and rail development) and the 10,000MW of power projects, most of which are to be sponsored by private Pakistani companies.

As regards the infrastructure projects, Chinese state companies have a demonstrated capability to execute these efficiently and on time. Financing has been agreed. The Pakistan Army will provide dedicated security. Only bureaucratic incompetence or corruption can hold back the implementation of these projects.

For the private-sector power projects, some questions could arise. Will the Pakistani sponsors be able to deploy the required 20pc of the project cost as equity? Will the Pakistan government while under the IMF-supervised programme be able to provide all the sovereign guarantees required to secure the debt financing brought in by the Chinese companies executing the projects? Again, the actual construction of the power plants and dams should not pose difficulties for the Chinese companies selected to undertake this.

The successful implementation of the economic corridor projects would create ancillary opportunities and benefits. Energy availability would revive existing industries, such as textiles, to full production and add an estimated 2pc to Pakistans GDP growth. The improved transportation network would accelerate and expand internal and external trade. The areas adjacent to the corridor would become attractive locations for manufacturing, agricultural and services industries. Small and medium enterprises would be special beneficiaries. Employment and economic growth would expand significantly.

To derive full advantage from the economic corridor opportunity, Pakistans private sector needs to establish a much closer relationship with Chinas public- and private-sector companies. China is now the largest economy in the world. Due to rising prosperity and wages in China, parts of its manufacturing sector are moving to lower-cost locations including Vietnam and Bangladesh. Pakistan has not so far benefited from this economic relocation.

Pakistani companies and entrepreneurs remain heavily oriented towards the West and unfamiliar with China. On the other hand, Chinese companies have been mostly interested in executing construction projects in Pakistan. Very few of them have invested equity in Pakistani enterprises. A recent Chinese private sector delegation returned disappointed from their interaction with Pakistani companies.

A vigorous campaign can be launched to promote business cooperation between the two countries.

In September 2012, a group of us independently organised a conference in Beijing on China-Pakistan economic cooperation to bring together Pakistani businessmen with Chinas state and private companies. It was well attended from both sides and led to a modest expansion in business relationships. Such efforts need to be pursued more systematically with the sponsorship of the two governments.

Some of the specific steps that can be undertaken are:

- a China-Pakistan economic forum can be established for frequent contacts and exchanges between businesses in the two countries.

- A database can be established where business opportunities in either country could be posted in Chinese and English.

- Pakistani investment banks could organise sector-specific investment meetings where interested Chinese companies could interact with potential Pakistani partners.

- The China-Pakistan Friendship Association, which is now headed on the Chinese side by senior official, can also be utilised to promote business interaction and cooperation.

At the September 2012 informal conference, there was wide support for the establishment of a financed private equity fund dedicated to investments in Pakistan. Although an official China-Pakistan investment company exists, it has not been very active. A private-sector fund could make a more effective contribution to collaboration between the business communities of the two countries.

Visible progress on the economic corridor and the mobilisation of Chinese investments in Pakistan will also help in overcoming the psychological barriers to flows of foreign investment from other sources. Despite its restrictive economic regime, over 150 private equity funds, foreign and domestic, are active in India. Only three or four such funds are dedicated to investing in Pakistan. A conscious campaign by the Pakistan government, with the participation of the private sector, to encourage foreign direct investment in Pakistan is indispensable.

It is self-evident that, apart from security and perception problems created by a hostile Western media, foreign investment flows into Pakistan will depend on the health and stability of the Pakistan economy.

Three goals are central in this context: closing the energy gap hopefully, the corridor projects will succeed in doing so; reducing the budget deficit this cannot be achieved without a bold effort to enlarge the revenue base and ensure effective tax collection; and reducing the trade deficit. Remittances, privatisation and bond issues while important contributors to balancing the books and enhancing confidence in the economy, cannot replace the need for the expansion of exports, especially of value added goods. To this end, nationally oriented adjustments should be made in the trade regime, particularly to provide protection to emerging industries and enterprises.

Today, the Chinese commitment to the economic corridor has created a new and significant opportunity for Pakistan to revive its economy, stabilise its polity and advance its strategic interests. It cannot let the China cup slip from the Pakistani lip.


 

 

A Chinese template

TWO years ago, President Xi Jinping had first proposed the "One Belt, One Road", essentially a breakout economic vision for China. In an editorial this month, Hong Kongs South China Morning Post has described it as the most significant and far-reaching project the nation has ever put forward.

It seeks to expand the Chinese economy by first creating mega project construction opportunities for Chinese firms and then by spreading out markets for its manufactured goods. The plan is to accelerate growth in Chinas western regions and then integrate Chinas markets with Eurasia, the Middle East and Africa. Its one component, the Silk Road Economic Belt would connect Western China to Central Asia and Europe overland, while the other, the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road would substantiate the link between Chinese seaports and the Middle East, Africa and the Mediterranean.

The Chinese then developed a blueprint to translate this vision into an action plan.

The CPEC is a trunk passageway connecting the Belt with the Road.

Days before President Xis arrival in Pakistan the striking blueprint was revealed. "The Belt and Road run through the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa, connecting the vibrant East Asia economic circle at one end and the developed European economic circle at the other, and encompassing countries with huge potential for economic development." The editorial succinctly captured its essence: "Chinese companies [helping] to build the roads, railway lines, ports and power grids that are sorely needed in many parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East. That, in turn, will involve loans and swap deals aimed at making the yuan a global currency." Long term it aims for "financial integration with the 65 Belt and Road countries across three continents". A Silk Road Fund and an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank have been established to help finance these mega project initiatives.

That China has chosen to begin the implementation of this big bang template with Pakistan, one of its closest allies, is not surprising. It is being described as a significant opening move on the Belt and Road initiative chessboard. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is in fact a trunk passageway connecting the Silk Road Economic Belt in the north with the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road in the south.

Additionally, branches from this trunk are also expected to connect Afghanistan, India and Iran with the Chinese Belt and Road system. The blueprint document urges that "on the basis of respecting each others sovereignty and security concerns, countries along the Belt and Road should improve the connectivity of their infrastructure - and form an infrastructure network connecting all sub-regions in Asia, and between Asia, Europe and Africa step by step".

One can expect to see China urging Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and Iran to interconnect their road, grid and pipeline infrastructures with the CPEC trunk. The possible network effects this would create could conceivably be an even bigger economic bonanza for the region than the CPEC itself as the blueprint document contemplates removal of "investment and trade barriers for the creation of a sound business environment within the region and in all related countries". The Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline could be just one small example of this.

Explaining the modalities for execution, the document states that "China will work with countries along the Belt and Road to steadily advance demonstration projects, jointly identify programmes that - are agreed upon by parties and ready for implementation, so as to ensure early harvest".

That for now most of the money has been allocated to coal-fired power plants reflects Chinas assessment of Pakistans growth bottleneck shortage of affordable energy. It is also where Chinese companies could provide the quickest assistance with financing options. Most of the rest of the money is to ease Pakistans transport and logistics bottlenecks for regional connectivity.

Still other components include integrating industrial chains, clusters and parks so regional countries can build on their comparative advantage and entire industrial sectors can develop in concert. The document contemplates other forms of collaboration such as policy coordination and removal of non-tariff barriers among the countries. Most importantly, the Chinese cannot afford for the CPEC to flounder because most of the future success of the Belt and Road initiative may be predicated on its successful demonstration.

People have asked me what the catch is. Frankly, on combing the document I could not find one except to say that China may be projecting its soft (economic) power. On the other hand, there are two likely hazards on our side. One is the route controversy and the need is to urgently build political consensus and transparency. The other is bureaucratic incapacity and lethargy to execute the Pakistani side of the bargain. Islamabad needs to address both of these on a war footing.


 
The entente cordiale

The foundation-stone of an industrial revolution has been laid down in Pakistan. The all-weather cordiale entente is on the ever-expanding path. Pakistan has been blessed with an epic investment of over US$ billion 46 offered by China to built multiple projects covering 51 agreements under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The ground-breaking ceremony kickstarted for US$ 28 billion advance projects is expected to be completed by 2018.

The offer was unveiled after President Xi Jinping visited Pakistan on 20-21 April; his first-ever visit to Pakistan after becoming President in 2013. Both countries are regarded as each others iron brothers.

The infrastructure of many Asian countries is out dated. It needs new funds to be injected. Asian infrastructure needs at least US$ 720 billion annually. For this purpose, China has launched the Asia Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) last October with an initial equity of US$ 50, which was joined by a number of Asian countries to offer funds to build infrastructure in Asia. Many European countries have also joined the bank. Japan has been considering joining the AIIB.

There is no reason why the United States has been staying out from the AIIB and criticizing it. The action has isolated the United States. Pakistan is the founding-member of the AIIB.

Now, China has become a powerful factor in expanding Pakistans economy in the 21 century under Chinas "One Belt One Road" policy to connect China with several regions of the Asian Continent. Xinjiang will be connected with the deep sea Gwadar Port in the Arabian Sea. Besides Pakistan, Xinjiang will be connected with Central Asian Republics. China Yunnan province will be connected with Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India.

China has constructed the Hambantota port in Sri Lanka and is developing a number of seaports in Myanmar after upgrading the Chittagong port in Bangladesh. So China is vigorously concentrating on Asias road connectivity and seaports development for commercial purposes with no strings attached to military build-up as was propagated in Western and Indian media.

Linking up Gwader with Kashghar in western China is the dream of the 21 century. A road and railway track along with energy pipeline and industrial towns and an optic fiber line will be laid down to connect both regions for trade, commerce, and tourism purposes. This will be the longest land corridor ever built in human history, exceeding 2,500 to 3,000 km.

China has already promised to offer US 2 billion to build Pakistans portion of its gas pipeline with Iran, an indication of Chinas firm resolve to build energy pipelines and infrastructure in Asia.

President Xis address to Pakistans Parliamentary joint session was the first-ever by a Chinese dignitary and the first by any foreign leader to the present Parliament. Earlier, four Chinese leaders addressed the Parliament, a credit never taken by any other country.

President Xi paid tributes to Pakistan providing air access to China when the country was isolated. Pakistan was the first Islamic country to recognize China in 1950. He also paid tributes to the poet-philosopher Allama Iqbal who in his poetry appreciated the Chinese struggle and predicted in 1930 that China would emerge as a great country. He lauded Prime Minister Sharifs vision to elevate Pakistan to the level of an Asian tiger economy and this is indeed an opportunity for Pakistan to become an Asian tiger.

Pakistan and China were not significant trading partners in the past. However, on trade and investment fronts, they have crossed many barriers now. Trade has increased to US$ 16 billion now after the operationalization of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in January 2007 when bilateral trade stood around US$ 7.5 billion. Bottlenecks still surrounding FTA need to be removed and making Pakistani products in the Chinese market more competitive and attractive.

Bilateral trade was less than US$ 1 billion in 2001 and less than US$ half billion in 1991 respectively. Moreover, bilateral trade did not witness any significant progress during 1981-91 and stood around US$ half a billion. When relations were put on more robust growth in the early in 1970s, bilateral trade was recorded only US$ 54 million.

Interestingly, both countries traded goods were worth only US$ 14 million in 1961. Today, in Pakistans total global trade, China occupies a 22 percent share.

Similarly, China did not play a significant role in investing its capital in Pakistan in the past. Chinese private firms started investing in Pakistan by 1997 under its trade and investment liberalization policy and brought rather a small capital into Pakistani investment market compared to the United States and European countries in the 1990s.

It was in 2007 that China invested US$ 712 million by becoming the fourth largest investor in Pakistan but again its investment could not sustain and declined which comeback to US$ 700.3 million in 2014, by making it the largest investor in Pakistan. It is expected that this trend would continue and major breakthrough could happen in trade and investment.

President Xis visit hailed a historic development opportunity for the ailing Pakistani economy, which has been showing a positive outlook now. China wants to bump up the security of Pakistan by elevating it to the level of an Asian tiger economy.

 China -Pak estrangement corridor

Pakistan-China friendship, that was already "higher than mountains, deeper than oceans, sweeter than honey and stronger than steel" - as reiterated by signboards all over Islamabad last week - got even higher, deeper, sweeter and stronger with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which was penned via 51 MoUs last week. Echoing similar sentiments, Chinese President Xi Jinping had written in an open editorial prior to his Pakistan trip that he felt as if he was "going to visit the home of (his) own brother." Hence, it wasnt exactly the $46 billion worth Eidi that many are touting it as. China of course is looking to reap the benefits of the biggest overseas investment that it has ever tabled.

In addition to bolstering the Silk Road Economic Belt and getting direct access to the Middle East via Gwadar, China is vying to accelerate the economic development of Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the northwest of the country. Despite being the largest administrative division in China, Xinjiang has lagged behind the rest of the country owing to a plethora of reasons, at the heart of which is the separatist movement orchestrated by the local Uighur Muslims who envisage an independent East Turkestan for themselves.

The independence movements for East Turkestan can be traced all the way back to Pan-Mongolian endeavours from the 19th century. The battles of Kashgar (1933-34) saw Hui Muslims crush Turkic separatists to conquer the First East Turkestan Republic. The Second East Turkestan Republic was vanquished by the Peoples Liberation Army, the victor of the Chinese civil war that led to the creation of Peoples Republic of China in 1949.

In 1955 around three-fourths of the Xinjiang population were Uighur Muslims. In the ensuing decades, the influx and influence of Han people in the region and the skewed state policies alienated the Uighurs.

Uighur separatists orchestrated around 200 attacks from 1990 till 2001, killing 162 and injuring over 440 people. Following 9/11 China launched its own War on Terror against Uighur separatists, upping the ante on policies that have directly, and blatantly, targeted the Uighurs.

Following the upsurge in Uighur terrorism in the last couple of years that have seen attacks in Turpan Prefecture, Kumming, Urumqi and Yarkand, which killed hundreds of local citizens, the Chinese government banned locals with long beards, veils, headscarves or any clothes with Islamic symbols, from boarding public transport in the lead up to a local sports even in Karamay. As Uighur terrorism has risen, Chinas clampdown on Islam has increased in Xinjiang.

The CPEC links Xinjiang to Balochistan, which is the hub of a separatist movement of its own. The Kalat Operation in 1948; the Nowroz Khan led guerrilla warfare in 1958-59 against the One Unit Policy which was replicated under the leadership of Sher Muhammad Bijrani Marri in 1960s and Zulfiqar Ali Bhuttos military operation in the 1970s, laid the foundation of Baloch estrangement. The alienation was exacerbated with the military operation in the 2000s, which saw Akbar Bugti being killed in 2006. The current conflict in Balochistan is the extension of the Musharraf-led operation.

The major concern expounded by all Baloch leaders from Nowroz Khan to Brahamdagh Bugti is with regards to greater control over Balochistans resources and a fair profit sharing mechanism. The CPEC has opened old wounds, after the Pakistani federal government decided to change the route of the 3,000-km long economic corridor. The CPEC will now traverse Punjab and parts of Sindh, before connecting with Gwadar, going virtually parallel to the coastline after entering Balochistan. The reason cited for the rerouting is the volatile security situation in Balochistan, which is why the route within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) has also been altered.

While the claim that the CPEC is meant to benefit "Punjab only" is a slight exaggeration, there is no doubt that the government is taking the escape route, instead of addressing the genuine concerns of the Baloch locals. It is no coincidence that military operations in North Waziristan and Balochistan have been escalated in the lead up to the signatures on CPEC, with China alleging that Uighur militants are being trained by the Pakistani and Afghan Taliban.

Both Pakistan and China are brimming with paranoia vis-a-vis their respective estranged communities and regions. Both allege foreign hands in destabilising Balochistan and Xinjiang and both refuse to own up to their blunders in dealing with the Baloch and Uighurs over the past half a century.

Islamabad refuses to acknowledge that "Baloch terrorists" are but a fringe group in a province that is simply asking for its just share in financial benefits generated courtesy of its natural resources or geostrategic location. Beijing, meanwhile, doesnt realise that the Wahhabi Uighur extremists are a minority among Uighur Muslims, most of whom rightly feel isolated by state policies that target Islam and Muslims.

China and Pakistan are looking to address the gravest issues emanating from their biggest administrative divisions, through the long out-dated iron fist, culminating in blatant human rights abuses in both regions. While China is resorting to augmenting economic benefits as a means to quell Uighur separatism and unrest, it is still unclear whether Balochistan will get anything tangible out of the development of Gwadar port.

While China makes Negmat Rahman, a Uighur Muslim, the host of the Spring Festival gala - the most watched event in the country - and Pakistan makes Dr Malik Baloch, ostensibly a Baloch national, the chief minister of Balochistan, both countries are typically leaning towards tokenism to give unsatisfactory answers to uncomfortable questions.

Beijing and Islamabad might have collaborated to sign deals that will bolster both the countries economically and geopolitically, but if the two gateways to the corridor dont receive their share of benefits - both financial and political - it would further estrange the two alienated communities. Economic growth can never be founded upon military operations, human rights abuses, state sanctioned oppression and tokenism. For CPEC to become a veritable success for both countries, both Islamabad and Beijing would have to stare deep into the mirror, hold their hands up and right the wrongs of the past 50 years.

WHEN Chinas President Xi Jinping inaugurated at Islamabad on April 20, a $46 billion investment plan to connect Kashgar with Gwadar, he laid the foundation stone of an edifice of great promise. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) lies at the heart of Mr Xis two signature initiatives the Silk Road Economic Belt in the north and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road in the south. Together, they would connect China by land and sea to Central and South Asia, West Asia and Europe.

Xi Jinping became president in November 2012. Very soon into his tenure, he delivered two historic speeches. On Sept 7, 2013, at the Nazarbayev University in Astana, in Kazakhstan, he proposed forging "closer economic ties, deepen cooperation and expand development space in the Eurasian region, we should take an innovative approach and jointly build an economic belt along the Silk Road - To turn this vision into reality, we may start in specific areas and connect them over time to cover the whole region".

Less than a month later, on Oct 3, 2013, he suggested the Belts companion, the Road, in a speech in Indonesia. "Southeast Asia has since ancient times been an important hub along the ancient Maritime Silk Road. China will strengthen maritime cooperation with the Asean countries, and the China-Asean Maritime Corporation Fund set up by the Chinese government should be used to develop maritime partnership in a joint effort to build the Maritime Silk Road of the 21st century."

The CPEC, which links the two, was mentioned to the Pakistani president on a visit to China and to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Beijing.

To be sure, road-building in Asia is not a new idea. The prime minister of the Soviet Union suggested to the leaders of Pakistan and India at Tashkent in January 1966 the establishment of an overland trade route connecting his country with theirs running through Afghanistan. He renewed the proposal during his visits to the three countries in May 1969.

The US is seeing its influence in Asia slip away.

Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had earlier poured scorn over the whole idea in his essay Political Situation in Pakistan published in 1968. The political motivation was soon revealed when president Leonid Brezhnev propounded his proposal for collective security in Asia in June 1969. The Kosygin Plan was clearly part of the Brezhnev Plan.

In her magisterial work Roads and Rivals, the scholar Mahnaz Z. Ispahani, granddaughter, incidentally of M.A.H. Ispahani, brings out "the politics of access in the borderlands of Asia".

Road building is not devoid of political implications. But in the last 25 years the political scene in Asia has altered fundamentally.

A perusal of the full text of President Xis two speeches brings out two things. First, the remarks were not off the cuff. They were major policy pronouncements and the policy had been made public after full consideration with significant inputs by professionals, diplomatic and economic.

Secondly, Xi Jinping is realistic enough to know that hegemony is impossible. Hence his references to a win-win idea and rejection of comparison with the Marshall Plan.

The follow-up is important. A Silk Road Fund Co. Ltd. was established in 2014. This $40 billion fund will "provide monetary services throughout the Belt and Road initiatives".

This is altogether different from the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. China has promised $50bn to the bank. If 47 countries rushed to join as its founding shareholders, it is because they have no fears of Chinese domination. They include Britain, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and Thailand.

The US viewed their defection with dismay and subdued anger. Japan and Australia signed up with the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, (TPP) "one of the biggest trade deals in American history". The 12 countries which would comprise TPP together account for 40pc of the world GDP and one-third of trade.

Chinas reaction was in glaring contrast to that of the US. It concluded free trade agreements with Australia and South Korea. Shi Yaobin, Chinas deputy finance minister, correctly pointed out that "every members share" of decision-making power in the AIIB "will decline commensurately with the gradual increase in the number of member countries"; especially if the members include Germany, France and Britain.

To the US, however, the AIIB and its other components pose a challenge to its erstwhile hegemony in the region. It sees its influence slipping away.

In his State of the Union message last January, President Barack Obama complained that China was trying "to write the rules for the worlds fastest-growing region". He proclaimed "We should write those rules" as if the people of Asia did not matter. Chinas initiatives promise hope that the days of American predominance are about to end.

Citing joint venture of JF-17 Thunder, Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust Chairman Rafiq Tarar has said China has always helped Pakistan strengthen its defence.

This he said while speaking at a special sitting on the visit of the Chinese president held at the Aiwan-i-Karkunan-i-Tehreek-i-Pakistan Saturday. The Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust and Pakistan Movement Workers Trust jointly organised the event while Special Adviser to PM on National Affairs Irfan Siddiqui was chief guest. NPT Vice Chairman Dr Rafique Ahmad, Syed Muhammad Kabir Ali Shah, SM Zafar, Ajmal Niazi, Begum Bushra Rehman and Dr MA Sufi also joined in.

Irfan said no strings were attached to aid and assistance provided by China, which regards Pakistan as its Iron Friend. "Both the newly-elected premiers of Pakistan and China had met on July 5, 2013, and discussed the future projects. Unfortunately, he said, a period of 8 months was wasted in political hullabaloo, "he said, adding that more than 50 agreements will help Pakistan make prosperous.

He further said the government pledged special security for Chinese workers in Pakistan.

"An economic corridor would be built from Western China to Persian Gulf, transforming Pakistan into a hub of trade. It is a network of roads and Shahrah-i-Resham would just make part of it. The missing links would be provided soon and both Pakistan and China would be able to profit of the new Silk Road. Much of the Chinese investment would go to energy projects, which could help Pakistan overcome its debilitating energy crisis," he told the gathering.

"One Belt, One Road is a Paradigm of Regional co-existence," said president of Pak-China Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

He said that the project firmly focuses on the continent development goals.

He added that this model of shared destiny and cooperation is having a unique three dimensional character engulfing true spirit of reciprocity, kinship and inclusiveness.

Faisal Afridi declared that China will construct a new world economy that would serve generations.

While highlighting the significance of "One Road, One Belt", he said that the mega project aimed at linking China, Central Asia, Russia, and Europe, with the Persian Gulf, South East Asia and the Indian Ocean with Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan as starting points.

The land corridor between China-Mongolia-Russia will be built with Chinese province Heilongjiang as starting point.

Starting from Kolkata, the China-India-Bangladesh-Myanmar Corridor will be built.

The China-Central Asia-West Asia Corridor will be built with Xinjiang as a starting point.

An exclusive China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will be built to connect Gwadar with Xinjiang.

He further explicated that China has chosen to begin the implementation of this big bang template with Pakistan, as both nations are the iron friends.

He described (CPEC) as a significant opening move on the Belt and Road initiative chessboard.

The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is, in fact, a trunk passageway connecting the Silk Road Economic Belt in the north with the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road in the south, he added.

Faisal Afridi further elaborated that; branches from this trunk are also expected to connect Afghanistan, India and Iran with the Chinese Belt and Road system.

He said that the CPEC was not merely an ordinary economic corridor or a transit trade route, but it would be a fate changer project through which the Pakistani nation would be able to generate around 10,000 megawatts of power, a number of hydropower dams, a high-speed railway facility, educational institutes and medical facilities.

The CPEC would also be the harbinger of enormous job opportunities for Pakistanis.

Still other components include integrating industrial chains, clusters and parks so regional countries can build on their comparative advantage and entire industrial sectors can develop in concert, he added.

He explicated that according to the plan One Belt-One Road would be a series of initiatives under which several corridors will be built to boost regional economies to the tune of US$2.5 trillion benefiting over 4.4 billion population across 65 countries.

The initiative is not simply building roads, rails, and ports but introduces a comprehensive network of infrastructure development, he said and added that Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB), The BRICS New Development Bank, the Silk Road Fund, as well as China-ASEAN Interbank Association, and SCO Interbank Association will also finance projects built under this initiative.

Faisal Afridi asserted that One belt, one road initiative is an enduring methodical project that cannot be done overnight, thus states should undergo step-by-step advancement and by endorsing upon a pragmatic approach they should invoke various cooperation initiatives and mechanisms under the auspices of one road, one belt initiative to make it more effective and mutually reinforcing.

Unforeseen effects of the new Chinese medicine

WHEN it comes to investment pledges, $46bn is a sum that really grabs peoples attention. That is what China is supposedly ploughing into Pakistani energy and transport projects, according to plans unveiled during last months visit to Islamabad by President Xi Jinping.

Delegates at the Asian Development Banks annual meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan, last week, could talk of little else. The ADB, historically run by Japan, could not dream of such firepower. Last year it lent about $13bn across the entire region.

It is easy, of course, to talk big. Much of Beijings promised investment in Pakistan which would, among other things, help that countrys chronic energy problem by doubling electricity capacity may not see the light of day. (To put it another way, the lights may never actually come on.) Still, if even a fraction of the sums bandied about turn up as roads, railways and power stations, Beijing will be making its formidable economic firepower felt.

Chinas bid to extend its influence goes far beyond Pakistan. It is setting up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a rival to the ADB that will have initial capital of at least $50bn. Beijings one belt, one road initiative, which aims to improve land and maritime links between western China through Asia to Europe and north Africa, are gradually leaving the realm of fantasy and turning into concrete (lots of concrete) plans. To start things off, Beijing has dipped into its considerable foreign currency reserves for some small change: $62bn.

Chinas efforts to splash the cash mark a new phase in its diplomacy. To call it soft power might be a misnomer. Its authoritarian system still lacks the necessary attraction, although many of the countries in which Beijing seeks to invest are not exactly models of democracy themselves. The definition of soft power provided by Joseph Nye, the Harvard professor who coined the phrase, is "the ability to get what one wants by attraction and persuasion rather than coercion or payment". Billions of dollars look like payment. Yet loans and investments are not bribes. Part of US soft power as well as Hollywood and the attraction of lofty ideals was created by institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which spread Washingtons view of capitalism and opened foreign markets for US business.

If even a fraction of the sums bandied about turn up as roads, railways and power stations, Beijing will be making its formidable economic firepower felt

Whether we call it soft power or not, China is attempting something new. One Chinese official in Baku called it Chinese medicine. You might not know how it works, but that does not mean it will have no effect. Beijings efforts have been spurred partly by the limits of its hard diplomacy. Chinas build-up of military strength and its more assertive stance over disputed territory has rattled the neighbours.

Scott Kennedy and David Parker from the Center for Strategic and International Studies acknowledge the potential of Chinas new strategy to win influence. The one belt, one road initiative, they say, can "entrench Sino-centric patterns of trade, investment and infrastructure" and strengthen Beijings diplomatic leverage. The case of the AIIB does not look a million miles away from soft power either. The UK felt compelled to join in spite of Washingtons pressure. Of course, London may have been motivated in part by the prospect of financial gain for British companies. Yet that does not tell the whole story. In all, 57 countries have joined.

Of course, there are risks. Building vast projects in foreign lands is not guaranteed to please. In Sri Lanka, Chinas overweening presence was one of the reasons for the dramatic defeat in last years election of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the president who had openly courted Beijing. Even the generals who ran Myanmar tired of what they saw as Chinas relentlessly extractive and exploitative form of capitalism.

The fact that so many western countries are now in the AIIB could help to restrain Beijing from such excesses. Prof Nye says that the AIIB now will not be Chinese political slush fund. If the UK and others help ensure its projects are more sustainable and sensitive to local needs, they will whether involuntarily or not be playing their part in making the bank a more effective tool of diplomacy. Call it Chinese medicine if you will. But from Beijings point of view, having western governments help burnish Chinas image in Asia must sound pretty close to a definition of soft power.

The Gwadar Port, which started its operations about eight years ago, for the first time on Monday handled commercial containerised cargo for export of seafood.

M V Zi Jingson, a bulk-break vessel of the China Overseas Shipping Co (Cosco), which reached Gwadar ports outer anchorage late Sunday evening, was allotted berth on Monday to load reefer containers, laden with sea-food.

The export shipment will be unloaded at Jebel Ali, Dubai, from where a larger ship will carry these reefer containers to Far-East with its expected destination to Malaysia and China.

The managing director of local company, Abdul Basir Qadir Bukhsh, whose first export shipment was handled at Gwadar port, told Dawn that for the last 20 years his company had been exporting seafood through Karachi.

Federal Minister for Ports and Shipping Kamran Michael, speaking at a ceremony organised at the Gwadar port to see off the ship, assured that the government is committed to develop the port area for the benefit of the local people.

He said that the government holds Gwadar Port and the Gwadar City at the top of its development agenda as success of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) depends on it.

The minister said soon Gwadar will be connected with its hinterland through motorway M-8 and National Highway N-85, thereby providing connectivity to upcountry and beyond to Afghanistan and Central Asian states and western China.

The minister said that CPEC is the shared vision of the two friendly countries - Pakistan and China - and a very important pillar under the Chinese leaderships vision "One Belt - One Road" which is compatible with Pakistan leaderships "Vision 2025."

Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) chairman Dostain Khan Jamaldini, highlighting the available facilities and services at the Gwadar port, said presently it was being run by China Overseas Ports Holding Co (COPHC).

He informed the dignitaries, who specially flew from Karachi with newsmen to attend the ceremony, that the Gwadar port had been handling imported cargo belonging to government, like wheat and fertiliser.

He said it was for the first time that the local catch of seafood was being exported from this port which is a significant development.

The significance of this shipment is that it comprises fish from Gwadars coastal area. The locals depend on fishing for their livelihood.

The next ship will depart on 18 of this month carrying another shipment of fish, he informed. The export of fish will revolutionize the lives of local fisher men, he said. He said that 2,281 acres had been acquired for establishing a tax-free zone.

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is not a single road, its a network. It will spur the growth of industrial zones supported by energy plants, connecting Kashgar in China to Gwadar. Balochistan should be the primary beneficiary of the project. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will also benefit from it as theres no discrimination against any province.

These were some of the points raised by Masood Khan, director general of the Institute of Strategic Studies, Islamabad and Pakistans former permanent representative to the United Nations in a lecture titled Pakistan: security challenges and opportunities in the library of the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs on Wednesday.

Before his talk, Mr Khan expressed his sadness at the tragedy that had taken place in the city in the morning in which 43 members of the Ismaili community were murdered in a bus. He termed the dastardly act "a sad day in our history".

Mr Khan commenced his lecture by focusing on national security underlining four important things ideology of Pakistan, sovereignty and territorial integrity, social and economic development and development of democracy.

Drawing parameters for that he said, "National security is human security," a synthesis of aspirations and intentions of the people of Pakistan where "people are the centre". National security, he said, depended upon internal and external environments.

Highlighting the internal factors, he said terrorism was an immediate and existential threat while extremism, ethnic and religious violence, insurgency in some parts of the country and syndicates of transnational and regional crimes too fell into that category. He raised the question whether Pakistans ideology was under threat and replied himself, "Yes". Validating his answer, he mentioned the sources from where the threat was imminent countries that had not accepted Pakistan and forces within Pakistan who either did not want its ideology as it was conceived before 1947 or wanted a different interpretation of it. The latter included violent extremists as well as ultra liberals. Sovereignty was also under threat, from time to time, as drone attacks were one manifestation of it, he added.

Speaking on the external elements, he touched upon neighbouring countries. He said volatility along the Line of Control was an issue; Jammu and Kashmir was a disputed territory and India and Pakistan had different opinions on it. There was conventional asymmetry between India and Pakistan, but Pakistans "nuclear deterrent is effective". He called Iran a conundrum as there was a "simmering-down" when it came to the nuclear issue, but "heating-up" vis-a-vis Yemen. He claimed operation Zarb-e-Azb was succeeding because security forces were taking on extremists throughout the country. However, he admitted, the success was partial. Democracy, he commented, and democratic institutions were yet to take root.

Mr Khan said Pakistans relations with China were strengthening, and referring to the one belt, one road project he called it a "grand plan".

Expanding on the friendly ties between the two nations, he remarked, "Poetry is as important as prose." Describing poetry he said "our friendship was higher than mountains and sweeter than the sweetest honey, etc" and explaining the latter identified economic and political transactions as its components. He said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor was going to happen and Pakistanis should prepare themselves for it. He described it as a win-win partnership. In order to remove other nations misgivings, he asserted, "We want to steer nations away from competition to cooperation." He stressed that the corridor was not one road, but a network, which would enhance Pakistans capacity in different sectors of development. "It would have a profound impact on the economic growth of Pakistan," he said, calling it a destination and a pathway for many services.

On the subject of India, Mr Khan said since 1971 Pakistan had made many overtures to India most of which had gone wasted. By and large, Pakistan had been proactive but India had never wanted Kashmir as an item on the (negotiation) table. He mentioned the impression was that Pakistan was guilty. Hypothesising, he argued even if Pakistan capitulated on Kashmir, Indias hostility would remain. "Modi will continue with his aggressive posture against all his neighbours," he said and advised "Pakistan should deal with India with dignity. Dont go back on Kashmir even if India is reluctant or evasive about it."

With reference to Pakistan-Afghanistan relations, Mr Khan said they had entered a new phase. Pakistan reciprocated president Ashraf Ghanis warm gestures, making a fresh beginning because now there were "no good or bad terrorists".

He also briefly talked about the positive economic indicators suggesting it was a good time for Pakistan, adding that owing to the CPEC confidence of the world in Pakistans economy had grown. Drawing the audiences attention to Pakistans strengths, he said it had a geo-strategic importance, operation Zarb-e-Azb was succeeding which had made a major difference and democracy was taking root. He said some people believed that terrorism should be eliminated from society first after which efforts should be made for economic growth. In his opinion, it could happen simultaneously.

After the lecture the floor was opened for a question-and-answer session. Replying to a query on provinces reservation about the CPEC, Mr Khan said its not a single road or one link but a network; an access was being developed which would cause a mushroom growth of industrial zones, connecting Kashgar to Gwadar. He clarified that Balochistan would be the primary beneficiary of the project; KP would too benefit from it. "Some would be early harvest projects while others would reap dividends later."

On Narendra Modis intended cricket diplomacy, Mr Khan said, "If he makes an overture its bound to succeed. To what extent, I dont know."

Responding to the question on Pakistans involvement in the current Middle East crisis, he said it was a millstone around our neck. We should have invested in economic policies there. Its our prerogative to pursue a balanced foreign policy in the region. He predicted, "The situation in the Middle East is likely to deteriorate."


 


Japans Reluctance to Join AIIB

It is the rise of China. Even wars cannot stop this. The cycle of economic power is infinite. When new powerful institutions emerge, old ones get withered. So is power and its values. Economic power has a shifting method and is swinging to China gradually from the United States , Japan and some of European contenders. Historically, China has always been an important economic player in worlds history and it is regaining that status again. It was the Indian Sub-continent, which used to be another economic power in the region in the course of history along with China. By 1820 more than 70 percent of worlds GDP was produced by only China and the Indian Subcontinent. European powers gained economic power only through exploitation of natural and human resources. Colonial exploitation of both China and the Indian Sub-continent reduced them to poverty-ridden nations.

A number of big and small wars diluted American and European financial supremacy after 1945. American economic climax reached all time high in 1950s but then steadily declined following its preoccupation in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. On the other hand, in the past 35 years, China remained occupied in trade, investment, and transfer of technology to boost its economy. After 1978, Chinese GDP made a leap forward and surpassed the American Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) by the end of previous year.

Japan is the third largest economy in the world after China replaced its ranking five years ago. Are both nations drifting away or getting closer? Since the last year, they have been moving to pick up an olive branch in their bilateral relations.Asian economies are enlarging at a rapid pace. These economies need to accommodate each other for political and geo-strategic reasons - something achieved by European powers in the past. China and Japan rightfully realize not to miss the opportunities in this regard. They need stability. Harmony in bilateral relations is the lesson they have learn through historical realities. The Chinese-sponsored Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) could bridge their differences even more than any other platform available at this hour of time. Japan is however still reluctant to join the AIIB although 57 countries including Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Australia, and India have joined the AIIB.

It may be a setback to the United States and Japan as the G-20 and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) have already joined the AIIB. In this backdrop the US and Japan cannot hold the newly emerging world economic order any longer. Japan has been yielding to pressure from the US in its reluctance to join AIIB. Japan does not want to embarrass the United States and take risks at present.

Japan is shocked by the rise of China and its effective shaking of the postwar financial system. Japan has been the beneficiary of this system. Japan may be avoiding a subordinate position under the Chinese leadership due to domestic political pressures. The Japanese-led Asian Development Bank (ADB) is also likely to lose its standing and preeminence in the region since 1966.

The AIIB indicates a relative departure and decline of US and Japanese financial power and its shifting to China. It is pertinent to note that with the exception of USA, all of Japans allies have joined the AIIB. This has put Japan into a more critical situation with reference to its role as an economic power in future. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is of the view that the ADB should be strengthened to provide funds for infrastructure and investment. Japan has a strong presence in World Bank and IMF etc. The Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) also extends loans for the same purpose. On the contrary, Japanese media has been pushing the Government to join the AIIB instead of losing the opportunity. It is expected that Japan will join the AIIB in near future . If Japan prefers to stay out, it will just be isolated and deprive itself of multi-billion dollars infrastructure opportunities in Asia. The AIIB shakes the Bretton Woods system, which is based upon gold and foreign reserves in American dollars and established at the end of World War to maintain American hegemony in financial and economic institutions. The Bretton Woods system was an exploitative system of financial governance, which mainly served the interests of the capitalist countries and used southern or developing countries for their neo-colonial objectives to continuously exploit their resources and strengths. After 70 years of the Bretton Woods dominated system and its dismal achievements in the third world , new financial institutions are needed to address the economic problems of these countries.

AIIB visualizes that the WB, IMF, and ADB system of loans extensions etc is not workable in Asia any longer. Asia needs massive funds to upgrade its existing infrastructure on terms and conditions which positively take care of mutual interests. China has established the US$ 40 billion Silk Road Fund. This would create opportunities to assist development of physical infrastructure under the One Belt One Road - a Chinese dream for the 21 Century. A parallel system of financing is being established. The recent ADB Baku moot has decided to cooperate with the AIIB. AIIB is going to be a soft victory for Chinese financial diplomacy in Asia.

Economic corridor challenges

The lack of political consensus and insecurity would be two major challenges towards the implementation of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project. Failure to address these irritants will continue to affect Pakistans trade and economic engagement with countries in the region, thus negatively impacting national development.

The need to address these challenges has never been so important as now, when Pakistan is set to join the race for economic development and regional connectivity. Chinese scholars see this emerging regional connectivity as tantamount to reshaping the regions outlook, with Pakistan holding a central position.

In that regard, a consensus reached among Pakistans political leadership to set up a special bicameral parliamentary committee for regular oversight of the CPEC project is a positive move. If the committee becomes an active forum, it will certainly help address the concerns of all the provinces and political parties. As the government has a history of setting up non-delivering committees, one can only hope that things will be better this time. A non-functional oversight committee will also be detrimental for policy and the execution sustainability of the CPEC project. The corridor will take at least two decades to be completed and during this time several governments will change in Pakistan.

Know more: Special committee to oversee CPEC project

There is hope that the CPEC will change the regional economic and strategic environment.

This writers recent interactions with Chinese scholars and officials suggested the latter are extremely enthusiastic about the CPEC project. They see it as a flagship project of Chinas vision of Belt and Road a brief version of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road. They anticipate that a successful implementation of the corridor project will encourage other regional countries, including Central Asian states, to engage in similar projects with China. The next target for China would be to pursue India, Bangladesh and Myanmar for the East Asian corridor. According to some estimates, these routes will benefit more than three billion people of the South and Central Asian regions.

During President Xi Jinpings recent visit to Pakistan, nine of the 51 signed projects were linked to Gwadar. The Chinese regard Gwadar as the Tilbury of Pakistan. The port of Tilbury, once a strategically important deep-sea port of England, still carries huge economic and trade significance. The CPEC and Gwadar port will bring the same prosperity for the whole of Pakistan, which will become a conduit to multiple regions.

Gwadar is the tail of the silk belt, which will connect at Kashgar through different communication networks. The security of the whole corridor and Gwadar is a real concern for China. They are less worried about political differences in Pakistan, which they believe will be resolved with the passage of time.

Read: Media asked to portray correct picture of CPEC route

Both Gwadar and Kashgar are facing multiple security challenges. The Chinese expect that the establishment of five economic zones in Kashgar will completely transform the region and minimise the security risks such as the separatist and militant movements of the Uighurs. While they hope for the same about the separatist movements in Balochistan, their focus is on short- and medium-term security measures for the safety of their workforce and threats to the route and other projects in the country.

Though a declining trend in the number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan continued in April 2015 for the fourth month in a row, major actors of violence are still active. During the month, 50 terrorist attacks took place in the country, 10 less than in the previous month which claimed 70 lives and inflicted injuries on another 89 people. Although Balochistan appeared the more volatile region in recent months, the situation has gradually improved there; compared to 37 in February and 24 in March, 14 terrorist attacks took place there in April this year.

The military operations in parts of the tribal areas and surgical operations by paramilitary forces in Balochistan and Karachi have helped curtail certain violent trends. The increase in sectarian and communal attacks also indicates that the operational capacity of certain violent groups has not been reduced. The terrorist infrastructure still exists inside and outside the borders, which will continue to pose a threat.

Know more: Sound bytes: 'Economic corridor will have multiple routes

After work starts on the CPEC, internal security sensitivities will increase where even a single terrorist attack after a lull will increase the level of insecurity and damage the gains on the security front. The bigger challenge for the security establishment will remain the rooting out of the terrorist infrastructure in the country.

As far as the safety of the Chinese workforce is concerned, Pakistan can meet this challenge. The army has already announced the creation of a 10,000-man special force for protecting the development projects to be carried out under the CPEC. According to media reports, the new force, named the Special Security Division, will comprise nine army battalions and six wings of paramilitary forces the Rangers and the Frontier Corps. A two-star general will head the special force.

There is hope that the CPEC will change the regional economic and strategic environment. Specifically, in the Pakistan-Afghanistan perspective, better understanding on security and geo-economic issues is required for the safety of the corridor, protecting it from local, regional and global non-state and state actors. There are major concerns about the Kunar and Nuristan provinces of Afghanistan, where multiple terrorist groups including Al Qaeda, the self-styled Islamic State, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the Movement of Islamic Uzbekistan and the Turkestan Islamic Party, etc are concentrated. These groups can pose a direct threat to the CPEC in Pakistans northern region.

A better understanding between Islamabad and Kabul is also imperative to achieve border security. At the same time, peace and stability in Afghanistan are also needed if China and Pakistan want to maximise the benefits of the CPEC. Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif and army chief Gen Raheel Sharif visited Kabul just after President Ashraf Ghani returned from India. That indicates that both sides want to keep the trust and optimism intact. The prime ministers statement denouncing the Afghan Talibans spring offensive is a positive gesture. Perhaps this is also a positive sign for the prospects of peace and reconciliation between the Afghanistan government and the Taliban.


 

 Dragon-Elephant Pas De Deux

Who is more powerful, a dragon or an elephant? They are powerful in their own ways. Dragon has managed to achieve the status of a global economy. Hope the elephant is not sleeping yet or just dancing. The Sino-Indian bilateral ties have been expanding but also experiencing new constraints. The world is watching the dawn of the new beginning between them as well rivalry.

In September last, President Xi Jinping visited India and commenced his visit from the native town of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad. Now, when Modi reciprocated on 14-16 May, he also started his visit from President Xis ancestral home province of Shaanxi from where the ancient Silk Road used to begin. This was symbolic in deepening bilateral pleasantries and depicted a positive narrative of both countries relations.

They agreed to resolve their border disputes. A peaceful cooperation between the two giants is essential to bring stability in Asia. China objects the 1914 border agreement signed by the British authorities in India with Tibet by establishing a de-facto boundary. China has claims over Zangnan, which is part of the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh. Both countries share a common border of over 3500 km. The Tibetan issue in 1959 and the 1963 border clash deteriorated relations between the two countries.

It is in Pakistans interests that stabilization should come into China-India relations. When President Xi visited Pakistan in April, he addressed the Joint Session of the Parliament where he spoke in length about regional integration in South Asia. We need to learn carefully his statement improving ties with India.

The Indian economy has been catching up. India is the third largest economy of over US$ 2 trillion after Japan in Asia. A partnership between them is essential to build a truly an Asian century. The adverse relationship needs to improve between them. Pakistan should be confident about how China is reaching India or even India is reaching China. Our relations with China are out of any doubt and mistrust.

Similarly, India should understand the reality of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor. If India has not resolved the issue of Kashmir with Pakistan in the past 67 years, Pakistan can no longer wait to defer its development to bring prosperity to the most poverty ridden areas of Gilgit-Baltisan.

Without waiting for Indian consent, Pakistan and China demarcated their boundary, part of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir, in March 1963. This was a major tactical breakthrough in the Sino-Pakistani relations and a robust growth witnessed after that. The Sino-Pakistani agreement has been linked to the final resolution of the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India and after the resolution, China would negotiate with the sovereign State of Kashmir, Pakistan, or India whatsoever.

China signed a business deal worth US$ 22 billion with India during Modi visit to China. When President Xi Jinping visited India last September, a deal of US$ 20 billion was brokered. Within a short span of time of eight months, a total of US$ 44 billion from China into India is meaningful.

The Chinese economy has global reach. China has been investing worldwide. In Brazil, China has been investing US$ 53 billion. USA is also an important destination of Chinese investment. In Pakistan, it is worth US$ 46 billion to build the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Slightly lesser than this capital, China has been investing in India. Therefore, CPEC should also been seen against this perspective of Chinas global economic reach.

Similarly, under Chinas maritime Silk route strategy under the One Belt One Road initiative, China has been building ports in South Asia. China has completed the Gwadar Port, Chittagong Port, Hambantota Port, four ports in Myanmar, and is now building a port in the Indian State of Gujarat. The building of these ports is not for strategic and naval reasons. They are purely for commercial reasons.

China-India bilateral trade has exceeded US$ 70 billion. Addressing CEOs at the India-China Business Forum in Shanghai, Modi asked the Chinese businessmen to fully explore the vast opportunities and potentials available in India. Historically, both China and India were prosperous economies in the world. It was the brutal colonization that had shrunken their share in the global economic production.

We can hope that Modis trip to Mongolia, part of India East Act Policy will not upset his countrys growing ties with China. India should refrain from exerting pressure on China and encircling it from Mongolia, South Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. President Xi did not use his trip to Sri Lanka and Maldives for balancing Chinas ties with India. Asia witnessed so many great games since ancient and colonial times. It is time to reconnect Asia, overcome its poverty, build new roads of confidence and trust.

Altogether Modis China policy is confused, his biggest problem is China. He is confused between cooperating and opposing China. His balancing approach is not coming up. It is not yet clear if China and India are friends or foes. China has been pursuing a visionary and pragmatic approach in its relations with India. Modi needs to come out of his Hindutva philosophy of harassing its neighbors and using the Tibetan issue as leverage over China.

Moreover, Kashmir is an important factor in Pakistan-China relations. If India wants to improve its fences with China, it needs to prevent from bullying Pakistan to create an atmosphere of cordiality. China does not want India to object the building of the CPEC in the areas of Kashmir under Pakistans control. There is a provisional border agreement between Pakistan and China, which also meant that China endorsed Pakistans position on Kashmir until the final settlement of the disputed area.

Before Modis visit to China, Beijing conveyed the same to India as it first conveyed the same to China. This is Chinas absolute conviction in its relations with Pakistan. Similarly, China is over-conscious of its border dispute with India over Arunachal Pradesh. Global Times wrote no matter how much cooperation they can establish, border disputes will offset all progresses. India needs to develop a rational approach in amicably resolving border disputes both with China and Pakistan.

Business mood in  China

Unlike what one keeps on reading in the international press on China's economy slowing down and heading towards a turbulent economic period, I was quite surprised to find the mood entirely different when recently traveling in that part of the world. In fact the latest report from Accenture, a leading global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company, believes that China's slowing economic growth should not at all be a cause of concern, because it gives the Chinese economic managers the time to readjust to changing global realities; and this in fact they are managing extremely well as compared to similar trends being handled by most developed economies of the world. Since it was a board meeting of a leading economic forum that I had to attend, it was also interesting to note that even the mood of the Chinese economic bureaucracy was very upbeat. They have big plans in mind, and I detected no nervousness in any of them.

 For any country to become economically strong, it needs a sincere and competent government, capital investment, good education, advanced science and technology, corporations with global footprints, and a long-term focus of the state machinery and one sees all these things coming together in China.

Every annual board meeting of the economic forum has a theme and this year's theme was how China should be all about the long-term haul in a world where the rest of the leading global economies are suddenly switching to the short-term - especially in the Euro-zone and the USA. China on the hand desires to play a bigger global role in the corporate world and to do this it wants its companies to go the path of digitization and globalization so that they move up the ladder from manufacturing to more value added services.

While surely there will be many drivers for China's future growth, but the business captains I met clearly believed that the route to their sustainable growth lies in using more and more high end technology and in ensuring a global footprint of the leading Chinese corporations. It was quite impressive to see that even the Chinese government officials present were quite conscious of the need for Chinese businesses to move to the next generation of productivity. They sensed that the advantage their country has enjoyed with the low cost of its labor cannot last forever and to help the Chinese companies maintain their competitive edge the Chinese government has a big role to play.

The most interesting aspect however was the session on global trade, which immediately followed the high powered board meeting. Interesting, because in it the Chinese entrepreneurs clearly spelt their mindset on how they plan to find a solution to the growing 'protectionism' in the global markets. What we see today is a rising trend (post 2008 financial crisis and the recession thereafter) that points to a sort of reawakening amongst governments that their foremost responsibility is to spur growth and shore up employment at home and not to any larger romantic notion of trade for global good.

Even the world's leading/large developed economies who are today considered as the Knowledge based economies are ironically being seen going back several 'stages of growth' by arguing that a certain level of manufacturing base should always be maintained in an economy to hedge against unemployment, inflation and restricting undesirable imports. The United States of America (USA) as we know after a long time has renewed its focus on shoring up American manufacturing in order to replace some its imports and boost its exports. Just a few weeks back, the Democrat Congressmen in the USA shot down the bid of their own President (Obama) for signing the proposed TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership) on a fast track, as they see it to be treaty that is likely to cost Americans their jobs and erode their wages. Today's Japan under Abe is also being seen to facilitate national manufacturing in order to cut cost of doing business at home and to move back its off-shore production. The Chinese government and businesses are not worried and they instead look at things very differently.

According to them the US endeavor like the TPP or China's initiative like the AIIB (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank) are merely drives to Rebalance Relations between China, Japan and the USA. They contend that in the long run the TPP cannot be successful without China just as the AIIB cannot achieve its potential without the backing of America. The USA cannot afford to keep shutting China out from the TPP and likewise China also needs to make USA a stakeholder in the AIIB, and in its development cum promotion of the modern day silk belt and road. The Chinese further believe that it is imperative that rules of TPP will change in the future with China's accession into it, because, after all, when safeguarding the sanctity of global trade it will be difficult to set aside differences in certain areas (e.g. intellectual property); which as everyone knows can only be resolved by jointly striking a balance between a Western wish-list and Chinese concerns. And when it comes to IP rights the Chinese like to quote George Orwell, Believing things which we know to be untrue, and then, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right.

Latest: On my way back and in less than 14 days after the conclusion of the conference, one could not help but feel envious - about the speed at which the Chinese economic managers move - when reading that China and South Korea (a key TPP member) have now officially signed a free trade agreement (FTA). The signing of the China-South Korea FTA is a landmark case in global trade, not only because it signals China's confidence to open up its markets to Asian competition, but also because it points to an inevitable integration of Northeast Asia where Renminbi will be the principal trading currency. China of late has been deeply concerned about the prevailing international monetary system, which it calls unreasonable and to counter this it has been promoting enhanced global convertibility of its own international currency, the Renminbi. And it is also in this context that the China-South Korea FTA may turn out to be a real game changer in the world of global finance.

In Pakistan's case also we are likely to see (in not too distant a future) a similar demand from China, vis-a-vis the CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor), to increasingly move towards adopting Renminbi in our economic dealings (or at least the ones with China), and personally I feel that it will not be a bad move to become a supportive partner in the Renminbi convertibility drive, as and when the time comes!

Asia's parallel paradigms

IT is now almost a truism that Asia will be the focal point of geopolitics in the 21st century as Europe was in the last 200 years. The reasons are evident: two-thirds of the world's people inhabit Asia and it produces more than half of world output. Despite the current economic slowdown, Asia will remain the engine of global growth in the coming decades.

At the centre of this tectonic shift is China. Its pace of economic growth and scale of poverty reduction is unprecedented in history. China's rise has already changed the security and development dynamics in Asia; it is now poised to change the Western-dominated global economic and political order.

Thucydides posited that conflict is inevitable when rising powers emerge to challenge ruling ones. Most pundits thus predict conflict and confrontation between China and the United States, today's dominant power. However, such conflict and confrontation is not inevitable.

Today, global affairs operate under two parallel paradigms: one, the traditional paradigm of power and rivalry; two, the emerging paradigm of interdependence and common interest. At the present stage of history, both paradigms coexist uneasily.

Obviously, old habits die hard. The power paradigm remains dominant in the policy establishments of the US, China and other states. But the new paradigm is becoming more compelling, for more people, in more places.

Under the old power paradigm, the US, China and other powers have continued to pursue their national interests in a zero sum game.

The US is building a string of alliances around China's periphery (Japan, Australia, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam and, putatively, India). The Chinese pushback is visible in the new relationships with Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and as far away as Latin America (close to the US 'periphery') and the consolidation of old relationships, such as with Pakistan.

The US is shifting most of its naval power from the Atlantic to the Pacific (as part of the 'pivot' to Asia). In response, China has declared the intention to build and deploy a blue water navy.

The rivalry now extends to trade and development, including: access to natural resources; mutually exclusive trade blocs; rival development models and institutions, and the struggle for control of global economic and financial institutions.

There are a number of global issues where cooperation is essential between the two leading powers.

There are several security challenges that have been exacerbated by this great power rivalry. It has prevented them from taking effective and coordinated action to control the maverick regime in North Korea. Contrary to the interests of all, the Korean peninsula is now nuclearised.

Similarly, no stable security structure has been evolved to manage the complex rivalries between China, the US, Japan, South Korea and Russia in North East Asia. The Sino-Japanese dispute over two small islands could spark a confrontation involving the US and its other allies.

The most immediate threat of direct confrontation between China and the US today arises from the multifaceted disputes over the Spratly islands in the South China Sea. China's 'string of pearls' position is being challenged by the US 'string of alliances' around China, accompanied by assertive overflights and naval patrols.

The South Asian subcontinent is a neglected powder keg. Another confrontation between India and Pakistan is an ever-present possibility because of Kashmir, Balochistan, terrorism, a border incident, a conventional and nuclear arms build-up. The US encouragement of India's ambitions as a means of containing China, adds an ominous strategic dimension to the India-Pakistan rivalry. This extension of great power competition now extends to other South Asian states Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal, as well as Afghanistan.

Fortunately, the power paradigm is not the only driving force in world affairs today. The parallel paradigm of interdependence and convergence is also in play.

The US and China are highly dependent on each other to maintain economic growth and prosperity. China's growth is fuelled considerably by its exports to the US. Conversely, living standards in the US would decline sharply in the absence of cheap imports from China.

China holds a considerable part of the debt issued by the US. A collapse of the US currency or contraction of the US economy is against China's interests.

China has benefited greatly from US and other foreign investment and associated technology transfers and continues to do so. Now, China itself has emerged as a significant source of investment, not only in resource-extraction, but also industrial and infrastructure development in the developing and developed countries, including the US and Europe. China's 'One Belt, One Road' initiative, involving land and sea trade corridors, will constitute a major contribution to the further integration of the global economy and rising prosperity across Asia as well as Europe and Africa. While this will consolidate and enlarge China's influence and power, its impact will be highly positive for all participants, including the US.

There are a number of global issues where cooperation is essential between the two leading powers as well as other countries. Climate change threatens the entire planet. The US, China and other major carbon emitters Europe and India are required to take joint action to reduce emissions and build a world economy based on green energy.

Global growth can be sustained, and poverty elimination achieved within decades, but only if mutually reinforcing and collaborative policies are adopted by the leading economies on trade, finance and investment. Such close collaboration is increasingly indispensable on a growing number of other issues: disease control; cyber security; outer space; non-proliferation and terrorism.

Finally, despite their strategic competition, all major powers have a common interest in containing and resolving the growing plethora of inter-state and intra-state conflicts that rage across Asia and the Middle East. The interdependence paradigm is gaining grass-roots support in most major powers within civil society, business, the media, academia and in international organisations. Given the growing evidence and urgency of multiple global challenges, and the compulsion to cooperate for survival and stability, it is probable that the 21st century may witness a historic shift from strategic competition to comprehensive cooperation. The challenge is how to manage the current dangerous transition from the power paradigm to the paradigm of interdependence.


 
Pakistan's connectivity ventures

In the context of globalisation, connectivity, diplomacy and trade do not stand-alone; rather are part of a comprehensive concept. If the political and territorial disputes are settled, only then can borders become a source of flow and not obstruction. Here, connectivity and mobility are essential contributors towards prosperity and wellbeing of the people, where Pakistan is well on its way to improving intra-city and inter-city connectivity and mobility within the country as well as with its neighbouring countries.

The completion of trans-border projects shall ensure Pakistan's connectivity to Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey and Central Asia, ensuring speedy movement of personnel, goods and services between these countries. This coupled with three alignments of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), would result in qualitative up-gradation of Pakistan's land connectivity related infrastructure. The CPEC provides a unique opportunity for Pakistan to boost its strategic and economic position, where projects and associated economic development ventures are expected to generate millions of direct and indirect jobs. As a result, within a decade or so, there would be significant change in the patterns of personnel and goods movement, quality of services would improve significantly, new trade flow patterns and economic profiles would emerge and glimpses of peoples' prosperity shall be in sight.

Pakistan also stands committed to enhance Regional connectivity in the SAARC region, where the 18th SAARC Heads of State and Government Summit, considered three draft agreements to promote regional prosperity in South Asian region. While the agreement on Energy Cooperation was signed during the summit, the other two agreements on motor vehicles and Railways could not be signed due to legal and technical deficiencies, with Pakistan taking the position of not signing the agreements in haste. The two agreements for regional connectivity are under discussion since 2007, yet prior completion of legal and procedural requirements as enshrined under the SAARC charter were not completed before submitting the agreements before the 18th Summit. The summit declaration stated that: SAARC Heads of State/ Government welcomed the significant progress towards finalization of the SAARC Motor Vehicles Agreement and SAARC Regional Railways Agreement and agreed to hold a Meeting of the Transport Ministers within three months in order to finalize the Agreements for approval. Given the far-reaching implications of these agreements, the government of Pakistan is actively pursuing these agreements to enhance regional connectivity in SAARC region in a seamless manner.

Pakistan has also announced the construction of two motorways and inter- province connectivity projects, connecting Pakistan with Central Asia. The Prime Minister recently told the National Assembly that the Gwadar-Termez motorway will connect Gwadar to Central Asia, as Termez lies between Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. From Gwadar, this 650 km road which meets Chaman will be completed by 2016. The route from Termez to Mazar-e-Sharif, will go to Chaman vain Kandahar. As this project will finish, Balochistan will be better connected to areas near it, and Quetta will stand connected to the rest of the country as well as the Central Asian region by road. The motorway from Peshawar to Torkham and then to Jalalabad is also under construction and would be completed very soon, where it will connect with Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif and Termez, with Pakistan having two routes to access Central Asia.

The federal and provincial governments are undertaking large projects for roads and communication in Pakistan, where these will connect the whole country and each province to one another. These projects will go a long way in forging national unity due to a better means of interacting with people. The federal government has promised at least Rs 22.5 billion in development funds for connectivity related projects in Karachi, such as The Green Line project, costing at least Rs 20-25 billion, easing the mobility of people in Karachi. The Lahore Metro Bus, another project, was built through provincial government funds. Work on the Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway is under way, where it would connect Karachi and Hyderabad to Lahore.

During the Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Pakistan, the two countries signed 51 Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) and agreements, worth about $46 billion. This wholesome spectrum covers everything from energy to key elements of infrastructure development, including roads, highways, port facilities, airports and communication links. The Gwadar-Kashgar road link is an important portion of Chinese vision of One Road One Belt (OBOR), connecting three continents of Asia, Africa and Europe, and aimed at connecting Pacific with Atlantic. This strip has a pivotal role in connecting the maritime and land components of the 21st Century Silk Route, where concessional Chinese loans will help finance the upgrading of a number of key highways of Pakistan and development of a deep sea port at Gwadar.

Materialization of CPEC has the potential to transform Pakistan into a regional hub for trade and investment boasting infrastructure. It will go a long way in reversing the country's fortunes, which have been held back for years by a dilapidated infrastructure base. This corridor will benefit all provinces and areas in Pakistan, specially focusing on underdeveloped areas. It will also enable China to create a much shorter and cheaper route for trade and investment in south, central and west Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

Since President Xi Jinping put forward the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road strategic belt, China has accelerated the pace of implementing the concept. BCIM has been included in the recently released vision and proposed actions have been outlined on jointly building the belt and road. However, putting this vision into action needs collective will and perseverance, even though full implementation of all these projects may be a few decades away. Nevertheless, owing to nation-wide political consensus, Gwadar-Kashgar component of the broader vision is likely to materialise sooner than expected. This would provide China the shortest access to a deep sea port and would also offset the pressures related to stirs in South China Sea, diminishing the chances of any conflict in that region.

In recent years, Chinese influence has globally risen, despite considerable inertia from regional counterparts as well as world powers that actively pursue a policy of containment in terms of their influence in the region. As part of its strategies in other parts of Asia, China has expanded its influence principally through its economic power and soft power projections, ultimately with a vision regarding regional connectivity and increasing trade that would help China to emerge as an alternative to the Europe and the United States. Pakistan is poised to gain from regional connectivity programmes, for which it should continue to consolidate the political consensus to be part of these projects and improve law and order, especially in the areas through which these connectivity arteries are planning to pass.

CPEC a game changer

China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is one of the most discussed topics in Pakistan of late. Several aspects of the proposed super project have been examined. It is rightly placed as a game changer for not just Pakistan or the region but one with the potential to change the global economic, military and strategic landscape. Before moving ahead on the topic let's recall that CPEC is a series of projects worth $45.6 billion, aimed to connect Gwadar port in Pakistan strategically located on Arabian Sea just outside the Strait of Hormuz, with Northwestern China (Xinjiang) via Khunjrab (last town on the Pakistani side) along with several development and uplift projects for transportation, energy and technical infrastructure in Pakistan. An extensive development and uplift of road and rail links is envisaged with energy pipelines decorating the new silk road.

In simple terms the plan is to provide the world with a new silk road for global trade, places so strategically that it makes it the most cost-effective and quickest route. The port fees, access charges and transportation revenues alone would be worth billions of dollar for Pakistan. If proper policies are implemented, the industrial and business developments particularly along the routes can turn Pakistan into a global economic powerhouse.

This scribe was invited in a seminar at Hameed Nizami Press Institute (HNPI) as a keynote speaker on the subject. Mian Iftikhar, the head of the Engineers Study Forum worked extensively with his team to invite a bouquet of experts from various fields. The result was a brilliant seminar which thoroughly covered almost all the aspects relating to CPEC. Though all the speakers were learned and did justice to their subject, Engineer Iftikhar ul Haq and Mrs Naheed Ghazanfar from UET covered areas largely neglected in CPEC. The latter explained the technical details of the construction and potential of tens of thousands of jobs resulting from the construction projects alone. Her experience of having already worked with Chinese on critical projects came in handy there. In addition to the above the following points were also discussed at the said event.

A common perception has developed amongst the masses of late that CPEC is all about the road network being built to link Gwadar with China. This is not true as one can see from the list of the projects envisioned under CPEC and shared on these pages before by this writer. While undoubtedly the road and rail links are of fundamental and strategic importance with long-term revenue generation potential and the ones which can be the catalyst for a geo-political shift in the region, they are not this project is all about. In fact most of the projects are related to technical and energy infrastructure projects. To put it in perspective, more than 70pc of the proposed $45.6 billion investment is expected to be spent on these projects.

In addition to the benefits to Pakistan, the strategic benefits and significance of CPEC to China were also extensively discussed which includes the following:

Firstly China is heavily dependent upon the oil from Gulf. CPEC will reduce the transportation distance from 16,000 km to just 5,000 km for its oil imports which is transported via ships while 60pc comes directly from gulf, resulting in substantial economic savings, more business all around the year and neutralising the threat of blockade by political rivals.

Secondly CPEC will also give China unparalleled access to the untapped and raw energy rich markets of Central Asia and Afghanistan, These regions are collectively seen as the next big region in energy and natural resources terms. China envisions utilising this for securing its energy needs for the next century as well as placing itself as the world leader in energy security by having similar influence and control on the future energy sources as currently held by America over the Gulf.

Thirdly CPEC will also allow economic benefits to flow to lesser developed and troubled regions of western China including Muslim-majority Xinjiang. Also the enhanced security ties with Pakistan and economic developments, China hopes to eliminate the unrest in Xinjiang.

Last but not the least CPEC will provide China an additional key port, an opening to the world from its western side and the capability to blockade the oil supplies to any future adversaries by having a key naval port at Gwadar. The current attempts to encircle and contain China would therefore become redundant.

Moreover while it must be appreciated that the controversy over the three land routes planned to link Gwadar to Xinjiang is old and settled now with the Government promising to complete the western route passing largely through the underdeveloped Balochistan and KPK first, it is also a lesson for the decision makers. There are outside efforts led by India to disrupt the CPEC, evident by the now well publicised news of a RAW division established with starting allocation of $3 billion for the sole purpose of disrupting CPEC. Chahbahar port of Iran and Dubai port of UAE are at risk to become redundant with huge economic costs to them once CPEC is fully operational. This unfortunately aligns Iranian and Emirati interests with Indian. Moreover quite obviously, the strategic great game with aims of containing China translates into USA having its interests in seeing through it that CPEC does not become successful. With the vested interests of all these regional and global players at stake, it is advised that all local stakeholders be taken into confidence and CPEC branded as a national project instead of belonging to any one party. We must remember that no outside efforts to disrupt can be successful without genuine internal dissatisfaction.

AIIB: A hope for developing countries

As Greece struggles to manage its debt trap, it has already swallowed the humble pie of being a defaulter. Negotiations for a cash-for-reform package between Athens and its creditors broke down over the previous weekend and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Trspras called a surprise referendum to vote on whether to accept further austerity, or risk going out of the euro zone. Greece has failed to pay a 1.6 billion euro loan installment due to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after failing to secure new rescue funding. The global financial system, as well as the global capital market, will be affected by what happens in Greece. Incidents of similar difficulties faced by other European and non-European countries are not infrequent. Under these circumstances, launching of the Asia Infrastructure Development Bank (AIIB) by China is certainly refreshing.

Developing countries have breathed a sigh of relief as they expect better treatment from this new entrant. Pakistan has ceased the opportunity by being the founding member of the Bank; it has signed the articles of agreement (AoA) alongside 50 other founding members. Seven more countries are expected to sign-in soon, bringing the total number of founding members to 57. Signing ceremony was held in the Great Hall of the People. AIIB will be an important platform to channelize abundant savings available in the region into investment to help regional economies achieve sustainable and rapid development. Energy and communications infrastructure development is much needed in the region and AIIB aims to cater to these needs of the region and complement the availability of monetary resources in the region. Pakistan also hopes to draw financial support for projects such as the construction of roads, dams and power generation.

AIIB shall have equity of $100 billion. Pakistan has been actively involved in the consultations at all levels and after intensive consultations amongst the members, the AoA signing was made possible in a short span of nearly eight months since the MOU on the establishment of the AIIB was signed in October 2014. The bank is a regional entity with a legal status of a treaty?

AIIB shall launch with China having a 30.4 percent share of the equity, followed by India having 8.5 percent and Russia's 6.7 percent. The two notable absentees are the United States and Japan. Key NATO allies of the US like Germany, France and the United Kingdom, have opted to join the AIIB. AIIB limits the influence of large shareholders because 15 per cent of voting rights are allocated equally to founding members regardless of equity stakes. Though China's stake is over 30 per cent, its voting share is 26 per cent. Pakistan shall have 1.05 percent share and 1.06 percent voting rights. China does not seek veto authority in the bank, according to Chinese Deputy Minister of Finance, Yaobin Shi.

The bank will be operational by the end of this year. The AIIB can be construed as a natural international extension of the infrastructure development vision that has sustained rapid economic growth of China since the adoption of economic reforms. It stems from the notion that long-term economic growth can only be achieved through massive, systematic, and broad-based investments in infrastructure assets in contrast with the more short-term export-driven and domestic consumption development models.

Pakistan has embarked upon a gigantic venture of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which will be requiring huge financial resources, and hopefully the AIIB would come in handy when borrowing on affordable rates. CPEC involves a cluster of communications, infrastructure and power generation projects that would provide an integrating platform for over three billion people in Central, West and South Asia, the Middle East and Africa Regions. The increase in financial flows, investment, trade, digitalisation etc would bring peace and prosperity to the region, enhance the competitiveness of the economies of these countries, contribute to reducing regional disparities and social inequality, and improve life expectancy and quality of life in Pakistan and in the region. They way trade flows in and out of Asia would stand greatly altered when CPEC projects materialise.

Setting up of AIIB by the states representing 5 continents may be the first step towards reducing the IMF and WB monopoly on the world financial system. IMF and WB policies are responsible for the current economic instability in the world. Taking advantage of this evolving opportunity, Pakistan should diversify its borrowing, benefit more from the AIIB and bring its dependence on IMF and WB within manageable limits.

The US and Japan have declined to join the China-led economic outreach project, citing concerns over debt sustainability, environmental protection and governance. There are also misconceptions that Beijing could use the AIIB to push its own geopolitical and economic interests as a rising power. According to the Articles of Agreement, regional countries such as Asia and the Middle East region will shoulder 75 percent of the total capital base while non-regional countries such as European nations will contribute the remaining 25 percent.

The AIIB will symbolise China's rise as a financial superpower, guiding the world's biggest infrastructure financing institution. Whatever their reservations about China's financial rise, most countries see it as a fact of life that cannot be stalled by staying out of the AIIB. They would rather be a part of it, getting a share of the infrastructure orders that the AIIB will finance.

US President Barack Obama says China may steer AIIB loans to meet political or strategic considerations rather than economic. The US as chief shareholder of the World Bank has always viewed it as a foreign policy tool. During the Cold War, the US happily backed loans to the third World countries in exchange for their willingness to the US foreign policy objectives. Similar is the case of Japan, which is major shareholder of the ADB.

Head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, said the IMF and the World Bank are ready to work with AIIB. The developing world's infrastructure investment needs are too huge for any single institution, said Jim Yong Kim, World Bank president, We view the AIIB as an important new partner. Takehiko Nakao, Asian Development Bank president also welcomed the new bank's launch, ADB is committed to working closely and co-financing with AIIB to address the vast infrastructure needs facing Asia by using our long experience and expertise in the region, Mr Nakao said.

China's Minister of Finance Luo Jiwei said the bank would operate according to the highest standards and follow international rules. This is China assuming more international responsibility for the development of the Asian and global economies, said Lou Jiwei. He termed the new $100 billion bank a win-win for Asia and a new type of multilateral bank for the 21st century. The AIIB is one component in China's broader regional infrastructure plan, known as One Belt, One Road, which aims to expand rail, road and maritime transport links between China, central Asia, the Middle East and Europe.

We in Pakistan welcome the setting up of AIIB and view it as an instrument of regional development. At the same time caution is due for AIIB: it should watch out the overt and covert behaviour of its competitors, some of them are known for scuttling such initiatives by making them controversial by attaching negative tags of money laundering, drug trafficking etc.

It was almost as if a miraculous alignment of the stars favoured the making of deals. Not only did the USA and Iran lead the way to a resolution of the Iranian nuclear programme, but there was also an agreement on the programme that Greece had to follow to remain within the Eurozone. This came just before the first Taliban-Afghan government talks took place in Murree, which ended in an agreement to talk more. However, this tale of successful talks broke down in Ufa, where the meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit of Indian and Pakistani Prime Ministers did not end in a resolution of the issues between the two countries. Only if one is to assume the resumption of talks as a success did the Ufa meeting succeed.

Both the Murree and Ufa meetings were succeeded by second thoughts and explanations. The Murree meeting was followed by Taliban chief Mullah Umars Eid message, which seemed designed to allay the doubts of many Taliban commanders about the talks. Though Mullah Umar chose to give a theological justification, the concern addressed is whether the talks might not be premature. Similarly, PMs Foreign Affairs and National Security Adviser Sartaj Aziz found himself obliged to talk in more depth about the Ufa meeting, apparently to answer domestic critics, who did not say so, but were apparently angered by Mian Nawaz Sharif not having thrown Narendra Modi to the ground and then punched him in the face and stomach until Modi yelled Uncle. However, the stumbling block remained the same: Pakistan wants the Kashmir issue resolved, India does not want it even talked about, saying that it is an internal Indian matter, not subject to bilateral discussion. It was noteworthy that the Afghan talks took place in Pakistan, but not too much must be read into it. Talks have taken place already in Qatar, Urumqi and Oslo. Apart from Urumqi, the talks have all occurred in countries with which the USA has close military ties.

The settlement of the Greek problem was not sufficient a solution, for it did not put Greece beyond any future crisis. At the same time, Spain and Italy were forewarned that they too would not be allowed to leave the euro the way Greece would have. The averting of the collapse of the euro did not just affect Greece, or even Europe, but the whole world, because the euro is a global reserve currency. The failure of the Syriza government to avert the reform measures, will have serious implications for it, and it is possible to see the proto-fascist New Dawn party making progress in future, as it exploits the misery that will continue to be visited on the Greek people by the troika of the European Central Bank, the European Parliament and the IMF in the name of austerity measures. It also seems uncertain how the deal will affect Turkey, whose application for EU membership, and of the euro, is pending. Greece has a hostile relationship with Turkey, but has been roped into NATO along with it by the USA. The reason for this, the USAs rivalry with the USSR, is being revived by the conflict in the Ukraine. The Greek deal also involves the whole Middle East, for not only is Turkey deeply involved in the region, but the euro looms larger in it than other currencies except the US dollar, which is not just the currency of oil but also the global trading currency.

More is expected of the nuclear deal with Iran, and it is expected that it will mean a revival of old Western ties with Iran, which have been off since the fall of the Shah in 1978. It comes after the USA has been fought to a standstill in two attempts to topple the regime that replaced him. The Iran-Iraq War failed, and so did the recent protests. However, though the regime remains in place, it has apparently led to the election of a President who was willing to do a deal. It is instructive that the main opponents of the deal are Saudi Arabia and Israel (as well as the large and strong pro-Israel lobby in US Congress). Saudi Arabia is a direct competitor with Iran for influence, while Israel is already a nuclear power, and would not like to see another emerge in the region. Both are also close allies of the USA. If Iran was to turn from an enemy into an ally, their positions would be threatened.

Saudi Arabia also sees that Iran has been jostling with it for influence in the region. Iran is backing not just the Houthis in Yemen, but also the Alawite Assad regime in Syria. It is often assumed that they are fellow Shia, but Iran has serious theological differences with both. Iran once had close relations with Israel, having had diplomatic relations with it in the time of the Shah; thus the nuclear deal averts Israel from attacking it. If Iraqs example is any indication, an Israeli attack on nuclear installations is a prelude to a US attack. A logical extension of the nuclear deal would see Iran and the USA working for a Mid-East settlement that would keep Assad in power while preserving Israeli influence. While the agreement should lead to Pakistan resuming its gas pipeline project from Iran, the way is now also opened for a revival of the original project, in which India was included. Iranian gas has become all the more important for Pakistan because it has to replace the dwindling supplies of indigenous Sui gas, as well as power the thermal generation vital to an energy-starved economy.

However, this gasline requires Pakistan and India to resolve their differences. Pakistan may well agree to a resumption of talks, but so long as India keeps trying to keep Kashmir from being discussed, those talks will not bear the fruit they are supposed to, of Indo-Pak amity. The conventional wisdom was that it required the BJP to be in power in India and the PML-N in Pakistan for peace to be made, but the problem was that this happened in 1998-2000, and the only result was the 1998 nuclear explosions. There has been an Indian rapprochement to the USA, though it has made it a zero-sum game involving Pakistan. That has meant that Pakistani policymakers, who had long been so committed to the US relationship should realize that their state would always come second for the USA.

Another complicating factor in the Pak-India equation is China. Iranian gas is important to it, because it needs it, via Pakistan, to develop Xinjiang, which is both restive and central to the New Silk Road. At the same time, the USA would not like Chinese development. US-China and Indo-China settlements need not precede a Kashmir solution, but they will have to accompany it if it is to take place at all. Therefore, it seems almost as if the one agreement that has not occurred, between India and Pakistan, is the one which is the cornerstone in ensuring that the others have meaning.

 China  renews pledge to complete CPEC at any cost

China has reaffirmed its total commitment to complete China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) at all costs after Pakistan's political leadership took ownership of multibillion dollars project that would benefit the two brotherly neighbouring countries.

This resolve came from within China's powerful ruling party - Communist Party of China (CPC) - and that too with a greater sense of gratification over the manner Pakistan's political leadership took a consensus decision about CPEC's western alignment.

"It's really gratifying that all the political parties in Pakistan have consensus on this project. CPEC will be built with consensus within 'one belt one road' framework", Chen Fengxiang, CPC's Vice Minister for International Department, has reaffirmed.

Chen, who spoke to The Nation in Beijing on July 9, was of the view that the China-Pakistan relations have reached historical level as CPEC will help further cement bilateral ties between the two nations.

China had to secure ownership of CPEC from mainstream political parties in Pakistan for a number of reasons.

There could be many reasons to that, but there are three factors which are chiefly responsible to push Beijing to secure political ownership for the CPEC project.

One of the three reasons is that it wanted to create a political framework which it would use to negotiate with other countries which will become part of the project called 'one belt, one road'.

The 'one belt, one road' project is also part of Chinese 21st century vision of reviving the old Silk Route that would connect 54 countries through land, rail and sea routes. The second factor for securing political backing for the CPEC is to ensure that all political parties are on the same page, and have consensus on the $40 billion plus project to be completed by 2030.

China had proposed the idea of CPEC to Pakistan in September, 2013 when Pakistan People's Party Parliamentarian (PPPP) was in power with party's co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari, as President of Pakistan.

The proposal was deliberated threadbare by China and Pakistan and both the countries eventually agreed on North-South route connecting all the four provinces through highways with Gwadar port and Kashgar, the western most Chinese city.

Apart from PPPP, the ruling party in China has also cultivated good friendly ties with almost all the political religious parties of Pakistan and deepened party to party cooperation on various issues of mutual interest including eradication of terrorism. Yet, the PPP and CPC enjoy unique relations largely for the historic ties between the two political entities of China and Pakistan.

The CPC was gratified on the role of PPP for hosting an All Parties Conference (APC) on the controversial issue of route change that helped evolve a broad based national consensus on developing the western alignment of the CPEC first.

This was followed by another APC convened by the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif which after deep deliberations also agreed to undertake the western alignment.

A high level PPP delegation, led by former deputy speaker of the National Assembly Faisal Karim Kundi, has recently visited China, conveyed to the CPC leadership of the decision about the western alignment.

"Despite differences among the political on other issues, all the political parties in Pakistan are on one page when it comes to China", Faisal Karim Kundi told Vice Minister Chen Fengxiang.

The 4000 km road being constructed between Gwadar and Kashgar as key component of the 'one belt, one road' that would eventually connect as many as 54 countries has been designed by the Chinese government.

Despite major challenges Beijing has opted for the CPEC to be undertaken first because of its feasibility.

Pakistan Army has set up a special security division for the security of Chinese nationals working on the CPEC.

According to National Highway Authority (NHA), the construction work on highway connecting Gwadar port with upcountry on the western alignment is in progress as Frontier Works Organization (FWO) has completed more than 500 kilometers road.

Similarly, work on various patches of the western alignment is also in progress including the strip from Burhan motorway intersection to Havallian and upto Thakot. Work on a number of bridges and tunnels is also being executed.

The 6th round of Pak-China Strategic Dialogues, which was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday, concluded with an agreement on early and effective implementation on CPEC projects as a key priority for both countries.

According to the Foreign Office, the two sides agreed on further consolidating the existing all-weather Pak-China strategic cooperative partnership in all areas of importance, especially political, economic and strategic. The Pakistani side was led by Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry while the Chinese delegation was headed by Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jianchao. The Secretary Planning, Development and Reforms, also joined the meeting for discussions on the status of projects under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

During the talks, both sides reviewed important aspects of Pak-China bilateral relations. The two sides held a detailed exchange of views on regional and global situation. In conclusion, the Foreign Secretary and the Chinese AFM agreed on the need for the respective Ministries of Foreign Affairs to remain engaged at all levels.

Earlier, the Chinese delegation called on Sartaj Aziz, Adviser to the Prime Minister on National Security and Foreign Affairs.

The Adviser welcomed the Chinese AFM over his second to Islamabad this year. Aziz noted that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had a fruitful meeting with the Chinese President on the sidelines of the SCO Summit in Ufa, Russia, on 10 July 2015.

The Adviser emphasised that the CPEC is the flagship project for the Chinese President's vision of the One Belt, One Road and that Pak-China cooperation on the CPEC would enhance connectivity and contribute to prosperity and development in the entire region.

Sino-US: Seeds of conflict

The seeds of conflict between China and United States have been sown, as insecurity and uncertainty surround the region popularly known as the South China Sea. From being an important transportation pathway for East Asia's and U.S naval commercial traffic, to the heightened tensions that surround it due to disputes regarding ownership of islands, South China Sea is an area that cannot be ignored by the policy makers of United States.

Taking into account Beijing's increasing sphere of influence in this area, Washington's policy makers drifted their attention to the South China Sea to address the challenges and opportunities posed. Having observed the persistent reclamation efforts by China on the several reefs in the Spartly Islands, senior U.S officials unable to mask their discomfort deemed it as downright outrageous. A resilient response was issued by Chinese officials as a result. This message was loud and clear: 'We will not back down and we are determined to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.' This situation has placed the two countries at a confrontational position on the chessboard. On one hand stands the not so gracious United States engaged in a focused strategic effort to gain control of the South China Sea, a work aimed at sustaining its presence in Asia and trampling upon Beijing's ambitious goals. On the other hand, are the mighty Chinese who are not intimidated by the issue or the criticisms posed by Washington on this matter.

The goals of President Xi Jinping became lucid ever since the Chinese ambitions to build a Silk Road economic belt through central Asia and maritime Silk Road through South China Sea and Indian Ocean were revealed. With these initiatives it was clear that One Belt One road initiative was similar to a Chinese grand strategy that assimilated domestic policies of economic reformation and enhanced international goals of China's economic and diplomatic influence. But Beijing's South China Sea policy differs strikingly with its peaceful one belt one road initiative which has hampered its relations with not only United States but also its neighbors. China's relations with Philippines and Vietnam are in a vulnerable state due to standoff with Manila over contested Scarborough Shoal and in Hanoi due to the placement of oil rig in contested Paracel Islands. The ongoing tensions will be harmful to the long term foreign-policy interests of China.

Mitigating the cloud of uncertainty and uneasiness that surround the relationship due to this pertinent issue, is vital to both regional and global peace and prosperity. Strategic clarity regarding the claims of both Washington and Beijing regarding the South China Sea with a clear demarcation on what is deemed as an acceptable proposition on both sides is the only long term solution for this problem.

The first and foremost step that Washington must undertake is to simplify its message involving the Chinese activities in this area and focus on its vital interests in South China Sea. United Sates has two vital interest regarding this area primarily regarding China's usage of unprovoked force against claimants of this region and in its own freedom of navigation (FON). Freedom of navigation refers to the areas that United States navy can access which are outside the lawfully established territorial waters surrounding islands. Perhaps the most misleading aspect of U.S policy is to warn China of obstructing commercial shipping routes in South China Sea, an action that China has not undertaken. On the other hand, Washington must also focus on preventing sustained use of force by China in the South China Sea. A Catch 22 situation emerges where a policy of restraint and engagement must be adopted by United States simultaneously.

In this situation, International Law comes in handy where U.S must make it lucid that China's claims must strictly abide by it and also encourage China to clarify its claims regarding the Exclusive Economic Zone. A clear definitive statement issued by China that it does not wish to resort to force to remove other claimants will be a healthy step to mitigate Washington's suspicions.

The issue of South China Sea cannot be ignored and must be part of the official rhetoric when the president of China and United States meet in September. Elimination of the seeds of conflict is crucial as they have the power to grow rapidly into an irreversible conflagration between the two mighty powers.

Regional implications of Iran nuclear deal

While attempting to gauge the strategic impact of the Iran nuclear deal, one is haunted by the dilemma about American as well as Iranian intent behind evolving the agreement in the form as it stand now. Is it a part of prior greater strategic understanding reached between Iran and the US, ultimately leading to gradually assigning Iran a key strategic role in the Gulf? If so, does it mean that has the US led bloc tacitly accepted the so far abhorred Iranian practices in statecraft as legitimate norms of diplomacy? OR Is it only a technical endeavour to plug in a proliferation attempt by a non-nuclear weapon state member of the NPT? If so, will Iran continue to carry the baggage of a pariah state minus the bomb phobia?

There are equally convincing arguments supporting either of the propositions. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the impact while keeping in mind both these streams. If the subsequent events are to be governed by the first assumption, then implementation appraisals shall be subjective and perceptional more of looking the other side. However, if matters move as per the second hypothesis; then again though appraisals shall be perceptional, but this time, biased with an objective to pin-down Iran irrespective of its implementation score. Technical parameters and performance evaluation criteria have enough elasticity embedded in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to go the either way.

Even if all actors are presumed to act in good faith, which is not the likely case, the treaty execution is likely to bog down into glitches. If the utopian feat of implementation of accord, to the satisfaction of both sides, is accomplished, Iran will not only be reintegrated into the global system, it will also contest the long-standing partnerships between 'moderate' Arab states and the Western powers. It will be able to enhance its political clout in the region and will have enhanced leverage to play a complex stabilizing-destabilizing role depending upon the prism through which its conduct is judged. Under this circumstance Iran is poised to gain and strengthen its national power potential. There will be status-enhancing changes in Iran's regional and international standing. Iran will continue to positively evolve on both fronts - be it the extent of global integration or its regional influence.

The Iranian Foreign Minister recently stated, The purview of our [Iran-US] constructive engagement extends far beyond nuclear negotiations. The reality is that Iran has its stakes in almost all issues in the Middle East. These include Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, nuclear weapons proliferation, and the war on terrorism, energy security, and the Arab-Israeli conflict. Washington's understanding with Tehran would not solve all Middle Eastern problems but would significantly reduce the underlying tensions.

The nuclear deal has the potential to fundamentally alter the strategic landscape in the Middle East and South Asia by initiating a new security paradigm. Iran may be increasingly re-integrated and the partnership between Western powers and 'moderate' Arab states may face serious challenges. This does not however mean that the US would abandon Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries. At best the US policy would revert back to the 'twin pillars' of Iran and Saudi Arabia/GCC to protect Western interests in the Persian Gulf and the broader Middle East North Africa Region.

In the context of Afghanistan, Tehran has been engaging the Taliban and meeting their delegates; therefore the possibility of Iranian participation in the Afghan peace process, at a later stage, cannot be considered too far-fetched. India was Iran's partners in Afghanistan in the 1990s; together they contributed towards instability of Afghanistan by nurturing erstwhile northern alliance and strengthening intra-Afghan ethnic divide. As of now, India is feeling isolated in Afghanistan with the emergence of a new axis for peace in Afghanistan, comprising Afghanistan, China, and Pakistan. Though India would like a replication of the Iran's role of 1990s, but Iran has learnt its lessons and its recent engagements with Taliban indicate that Iran is likely to follow a different trajectory, and this time Iran would prefer to harmonize its effort with Pakistan.

Pakistan stands to gain if the nuclear deal goes through smooth implementation; and wishes Iran God's speed in this regard. With the sanctions gone, Pakistan could immensely benefit from economic relationship between the two countries. Both countries should work together to sign a free trade agreement (FTA). There is a need to dispel the impression that Gwadar and Chabahar ports are mutually exclusive; a way forward should be worked out for making these ports function in a mutually supportive way. If the issue is approached with an open mind, workable solutions could be found out. It will be in the interest of Iran to strive for a berth in China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiatives rather than following an isolationist policy with regard to Chabahar port.

Ever since Iran and international powers inked a nuclear deal, India has been vigorously debating the meaning of the agreement for South Asia. Indian academia views the deal as a major breakthrough. Indian assessment has it that the agreement gives Iran unprecedented opportunity to restructure its economy and leverage its newfound situation to confront challenges of violent extremism in the Middle East; and that it also gives the United States space and time to fashion a new balance of power in the region, thereby creating a new geopolitical order in the Middle East. This assessment is fairly accurate. In the last decade, most bilateral discussions between Iran and India had nosedived to more of talk than action. Iran matters to India not only for cheaper energy but, increasingly, as a strategic partner in Afghanistan given the shared goal of limiting the Taliban's role. Moreover India envisages limiting Pakistan's influence in Afghanistan after the Americans exit. Its investment in Chabahar port shall mean placing Indian assets (workers, equipment, etc.) on the ground in Iran. Under the garb of workers and technicians, India is poised to place intelligence operatives to augment its disruptive effort in Baluchistan and beyond.

India had forsaken Iran during difficult times, it voted against Iran in the IAEA, walked away from IPI project and joined the American bandwagon of sanctions by cutting its oil import from Iran. In contrast Pakistan voted in favour of Iran in the IAEA, remained steadfast in IP project and vehemently opposed any military solution to Iran's nuclear issue. And Iran is not known for short memory.

Pakistan's ability of maintaining a delicate balance in its relations with Iran and Saudi Arabia during Yemen crisis and its efforts for reconciliation based solution in unison with Turkey are expected to now pay back dividends and Pakistan is likely to have better leverage than India over Iran as well as Saudi Arabia in the context of Afghanistan and other regional issues.

Pakistan should make an effort to formally induct Iran into Murree peace process so that it becomes a stakeholder in the political process. At the same time, Iran needs to do its part to dispel the public perception in Pakistan that it is not a party to the sectarian problem of Pakistan and that it is not involved in stalling the development of Gwadar port project. It will be worthwhile for Pakistan to support Iran's induction into CPEC projects. Pakistan should complete the IP project and not fall in the trap of clubbing it with the revivals of IPI. If India seeks to revive the project, and most probably it would, then IPI should be negotiated fresh and independent of IP project.

While implementation saga will take quite some time to unfold, all may not proceed the way it appears now; Pakistan should follow a flexible policy to cater for emerging scenario.

Opportunities and challenges for Pakistan in a changing South Asia

Recent changes in our region hold great promise, if the challenges are overcome, said Humayun Akhtar Khan, Chairman Institute for Policy Reforms.

He said this at a stimulating panel discussion held by IPR Tuesday at Islamabad. Prominent experts discussed the profound political and economic changes that are taking place in South and Central Asia and in the Middle East. The discussion focused on the effect and implication of these developments on Pakistan. Panelists included former Foreign Secretary Riaz Khokhar, Moeed Yusuf, Director South Asia, United States Institute for Peace, Washington, well-known anchor and analyst Ejaz Haider, and Ambassador Khalid Mahmood Chairman Institute for Strategic Studies Islamabad.

Introducing the topic, Humayun Khan stated that recent developments held hope for stability and growth in the region. Yet the outcome depended on how leaders shaped these developments. He said that there was a risk that opportunities may turn into challenges. Khan stated that China's increased role built on the One Belt One Road programme and an active Shanghai Cooperation Organization held promise for the region. However, its success equally depended on partner countries. Iran's nuclear deal with P5+1 augured well for wellbeing of the greater Middle East. It could be a boost for Pakistan's trade and energy interest also. Iran's role in the Middle East, however, depended on relations with the GCC as well as with USA. The Ashraf Ghani government showed good determination and maturity in trying to stabilize Afghanistan. Despite occasional acrimony, Pakistan and Afghanistan share common ground in moving forward. He said that, of late, India has had an active foreign policy. India is expanding its defence capability and does not shy from display of force.

Dwelling on developments in Afghanistan, Moeed Yusuf said that Pakistan and Afghanistan have no choice other than to move forward with talks for peace in Afghanistan. This was entirely in the interest of the two countries, as well as the region. Failure of talks would destabilize Afghanistan with profound effect on Pakistan and the region. The only likely outcome of failed talks would be civil war in Afghanistan with ISIS its main beneficiary. Indeed, there are spoilers, but each party must know that the civil war will no longer be localized. It would affect the whole region. ISIS presence would pose a far greater threat than that from Al Qaeda. He said that all countries must strengthen the Ashraf Ghani government. This was the last chance for Pakistan and the West to have a credible partner in peace. He noted that the Taliban too have made concessions. What went under-reported from the Murree talks was their acceptance to no longer use the Emirates emblem.

The Taliban also have reconciled to power sharing in Kabul and moved from their objective of removal of the Ghani government. A follow up meeting to the recent Murree talks is critical, he said. Governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan must overcome hindrances and find ways to manage those opposed to the talks.

Former foreign secretary Riaz Khokhar focused on China. He said that above everything else, the Chinese prioritized peaceful borders. This was critical to China's practical and businesslike approach of focusing on economic development over territorial disputes. Clearly, China would now play a growing role in South Asia and Pakistan will be a pivotal country. China's One Road One Belt is a grand vision of the present leadership in Beijing. This initiative, in which Pakistan's role was key, is of great strategic importance. He said that the idea was 'unimaginable' in its magnitude. Through a network of roads, rails, ports, and pipelines, it connects central China with the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean and, ultimately the Atlantic. It allows China to become a two-ocean country from its present access through merely the Pacific Ocean. China expects that greater trade and investment linkages in the region would benefit all countries. CPEC is an important part of this grand strategy. Some issues remain. Its success depends on security in Pakistan and the capacity and ability of GOP to implement the projects. It is crucial that Pakistan deliver on CPEC. On the larger level, OBOR too faces challenges. Extremism and security of Central Asia is a principal threat. In addition, a number of regional countries and world powers may resist China's increasing influence. China's leadership, however, is committed to OBOR and will do everything for its success.

Ambassador Khalid Mahmood discussed Pakistan-Iran relations in the backdrop of regional and international situation. He especially focused on Iran's recent nuclear deal. In his view, with a strong economy and improved relations with USA, Iran could play a bigger regional role. He said that this was positive news for Pakistan. Pakistan can develop trade and investment relations with Iran. The two countries could cooperate also in developments taking place in Afghanistan. He said that Pakistan would have to balance its interests and relations between Iran and the Gulf.

Ejaz Haider said that Modi has substantially changed the emphasis of India's foreign policy and has made a bolder statement of national security policy. He is strengthening the country's military power. He is not shy to sound offensive and to use asymmetrical warfare. Mr. Modi has merged foreign and domestic policy in pursuit of economic objectives.

Afghanistan's Catch-22: less violence or a credible negotiating partner?

The success of the Murree talks between the government of President Ashraf Ghani and the Afghan Taliban depends on the latter's ability to prove that they are, in fact, the ones directing violence on the ground. But there's a catch. As Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, the new Taliban leader, moves to assert his authority, violence will inevitably spike in the short run.

Speaking at 'Changing South Asia: Opportunities and Challenges for Pakistan' - a talk hosted by the Institute for Policy Reforms (IPR) on Tuesday - Dr Moeed Yusuf, South Asia director at the United States Institute for Peace, made it clear that bringing violence levels down will be the key to reconciliation with Afghanistan.

But he also warned that if the infighting within the Taliban continued for too long and it came down to the Afghan Taliban versus themselves or versus the Afghan state, they would be drawing on all militants who were familiar with and operated in this region, such as the Chechens, the Uzbeks, and even the Pakistani Taliban. This would lead to far more violence on both sides of the border, he maintained.

This may be counterproductive for President Ghani, who will not be able to justify his policies at home if Taliban attacks continue in Afghanistan. But no matter what happens, both Pakistan and Afghanistan have no option but to seek reconciliation with the Taliban, Dr Yusuf said.

Analysts predict grave consequences for the region if Taliban infighting continues for too long

President Ghani is Pakistan's best option. It's between him and civil war in Afghanistan, he said, before clarifying that this may be an over simplification. But, he added, that more violence there would only benefit the self-styled Islamic State (IS), which had already begun to flex its muscle in Afghanistan.

China's ambitious plan

Earlier, IPR Chairman and former commerce minister Humayun Akhtar Khan opened proceedings by summing up all the various events unfolding in the South Asian and Middle Eastern region. He also spoke about China's revolutionary 'One Belt One Road' plan, whereby Beijing aspired to regional economic connectivity by 2048.

Former diplomats Riaz H. Khokhar and Khalid Mahmood spoke about the regional importance and potential of China and Iran, respectively. Mr Khokhar, in particular, pointed to Chinese plans for regional integration, saying, There is a great new game on.

He referred to the challenges China faced to the East, such as Japanese and US pressure in the Pacific and its disputes with ASEAN states regarding islands in the South China Sea, saying that this had forced the traditionally landlocked country to look inwards to Asia and Europe.

Pointing out that this was not an attempt at propping up a new bloc or alliance, Mr Khokhar said, The whole idea is to integrate the region economically.

The Indian comparison

Comparing Pakistan's relations with India with Sino-India relations, he said that despite their territorial disputes and other grievances, both countries had adopted a very pragmatic approach, which was indicated by the volume of trade that went on between them.

He said that the Chinese had always subtly advised Pakistan to do the same. Even though they understand our difficulties with India, they have always pushed us for closer trade and economic ties.

In his remarks regarding the nuances of Pakistan's relationship with its neighbour to the East, senior journalist Ejaz Haider pointed out that relations with India were not matters of foreign policy, but security policy.

Normally, security policy is the tail. But in Pakistan, the tail has been wagging the dog, he said, tongue-in-cheek.

Mr Haider pointed out that all dialogue with India revolved around certain specific disputes.

Our major problem with India is its drive to project power in the region, and that won't go away even if all the disputes are resolved, he said.

He also raised many eyebrows when he said that it was time for Pakistan to rethink its belief that it could counter India's strength projection through military means. Mr Haider said that he was cognizant of the timing of his remarks and that under Narendra Modi, the hawks that wanted to continue to destabilise Pakistan had taken centre-stage.

However, he contended that India was far better off today than Pakistan was and could afford such confrontational overtures.

India interests the world and can get away with lots. Pakistan worries the world, and thus has less space to make mistakes, he said.

Mr Haider also made a couple of 'out-of-the-box' suggestions for normalising relations with India, which included taking the 'Kashmir-first' approach off the table, as well as abandoning the use of non-state actors against other sovereign states.

A team of United Nations peacekeeping observers yesterday visited Pakistani villages hit by Indian shelling the other day.

The same day Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said Pakistan would respond (to aggression) strongly if India did not stop it along the Working Boundary in Sialkot - the border between Pakistan and Jammu area of Indian-occupied Kashmir.

Hundreds of civilians have been killed in such skirmishes between the two nuclear neighbours since independence in 1947. Both said the other side had opened fire first.

Nine died near the city of Sialkot in Pakistan's Punjab province, and more than 40 were wounded by Indian troops firing. India said at least four villagers were killed on its side of Kashmir border by Pakistani fire.

The Saturday's tour of troubled area in Pakistan by the UN team was the fourth one during the last two months.

The three-member UN team was flanked by local lawmaker Ch Armughan Subhani, AJK Legislative Assembly member Ch Muhammad Ishaq, Gujranwala Commissioner Shamail Ahmed Khawaja, Sialkot DCO Dr Asif Tufail, District Emergency Officer Syed Kamal Abid and media persons.

The observers met with the bereaved families of deceased and assured the villagers of playing their part for permanent peace in the region.

We are closely observing (the situation) and collecting the evidence, the team told the villagers. The visiting dignitaries also enquired after the injured at Sialkot CMH.

Also on Saturday during a visit to Sialkot CHM, the defence minister showed the determination to defend the motherland.

Pakistan will respond with full force if India continues targeting the civilian population. Absolutely we have the right to retaliate, and retaliate in kind, retaliate in full force, Asif said.

He added, If India crosses the international border and aggression is committed again, we will defend our homeland and inflict much more damage than 1965.

The 1965 war between the two countries was fought for over two weeks in September, and on each September 6, the militaries of both states are eulogised.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif would raise the issue of continuing aggression at a UN General Assembly session next month, Asif said.

On the other hand, ex-US envoy to Pakistan Cameron Munter said in Karachi that Pakistan's concerns over India's ceasefire violations were legitimate.

Pakistan and India have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan region since both gained independence in 1947, and it remains a major source of tension. About a dozen militant groups have been fighting since 1989 for the independence of the Indian-held portion of Kashmir or its merger with Pakistan.

Speaking at a seminar held titled one belt one road, Munter said the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will elevate Pakistan's importance in the region.

Not just Pakistan but the entire region will benefit from the corridor, he said, adding that Pakistan's economic future could be very bright if the blueprint for the corridor is executed and managed properly.

People here have to want to see good governance, to see honest businesses, to see themselves open up to the world.

When asked about India-Pakistan relations, the former ambassador said, both countries have an enormous stake in good relations and I hope they realise that the success of one is the success of the other.

At this time, I hope that the leaders of both countries can listen to the people who are interested in working together. It is really up to the people of these countries and the business communities to see where their business interests are.

Pain for those most in debt certain to become more severe

AT the moment, the Federal Reserve's favourite message appears to be either 'not yet' or 'almost there'.

The Fed's almost zero interest rate policies evidently are to be with us at least a bit longer. Moreover, it seems far more sensitive, or even sympathetic, to the impact its policies have beyond the US than in the past. Yet the massive liquidity that not long ago was sloshing around the globe, courtesy of the big central banks, seems to be evaporating by the day.

The burden of servicing borrowed money, especially borrowed dollars, seems to be rising by the day. Deflation is deepening, making that burden even heavier in real terms. Emerging markets currencies keep going down and outflows from emerging debt and stock markets are rising.

A world awash with dollars is being replaced by a dollar-scarce world. The rise in the dollar means tightening, regardless of what the Fed does. The pain of deleveraging for the most indebted will become more severe

There is almost certainly worse to come. A world awash with dollars is rapidly being replaced by a dollar-scarce world. The rise in the dollar means tightening, regardless of what the Fed does. The pain of deleveraging for the most indebted will become ever more severe.

Given the plunge in global markets, spooked by a combination of developments both in the real economy of China and its financial market and in European share markets, it is hard to imagine the Fed moving in September even though the reasons are shifting. Last week, the surge in the dollar and the consequent tightening were a reason to postpone action. But with the global equity sell-off on August 24 and corporate debt markets coming under pressure, it is virtually inconceivable that the Fed will act.

It still is not clear how the pain for the most indebted will be distributed though.

Ironically, the US, long regarded as the most profligate of all borrowers thanks to the reserve status of the dollar, for the moment looks more immune than almost anywhere else.

Many companies will be less fortunate. Expect downgrades and defaults to increase dramatically, as commodity prices fall and cash flows dry up for an ever widening circle of companies in the commodities food chain.

Most emerging markets will have an even harder time. Many of the most vulnerable are tied closely to China, and the country's falling purchasing managers' index is worse news for them than for the Chinese themselves.

China itself, as always, is a harder call. In the past few years, it has become evident that its real competitive advantage has been an abundance of capital rather than of cheap labour. New initiatives, including the Asian Infrastructure Bank, the New Development Bank and the oddly named 'One belt, one road' infrastructure plan, are all about exporting capital to places such as Pakistan ($46bn soon coming its way) that can use it productively at a time when investment in China is losing its efficacy.

At the same time, though, lots of claims on what was once $4tn in Chinese reserves make that number seem less impressive than even just a few months ago. In the past four quarters, China has seen outflows of about $350bn and reserves have shrunk as export earnings have slowed.

At year-end, outstanding cross-border claims on Chinese residents totalled $1tn, according to the Bank for International Settlements, making the mainland the eighth largest borrower worldwide. Fully 39pc of that debt is in dollars. Moreover, many mainland companies borrowed dollars expecting the greenback to depreciate. Few expected that a renminbi that was appreciating ever more quickly would suddenly reverse course.

Goldman Sachs analysts recently concluded a study of the debt profiles of the top 125 listed Chinese companies, (with a collective $270bn in foreign debt) and found no worrying concentrations. But many companies use offshore subsidiaries and off-balance sheet vehicles.

While much of the capital outflow and the rise in the dollar can be accounted for by prudent hedging, jittery Chinese investors have less reason to keep their money in China than ever before. Capital outflows will only increase.

The end of excess liquidity and the end of excess profits have engendered the end of excess returns in 2015, the equity strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted in a report on August 19.

Excess pain, sadly, is likely to come up next.

Speakers at a conference on Monday termed Pak-China friendship exemplary, saying that ties between the two countries would strengthen their all-weather strategic cooperative partnership as Beijing and Islamabad are capitalising on massive opportunities of development to realise common dreams of the two Asian nations.

They were speaking at a two-day international conference titled Pak-China Strategic Partnership and its Regional Implications organised by Sindh University's (SU) Area Study Centre on Monday.

They said Beijing and Islamabad had stepped up efforts for economic development in Pakistan through bilateral projects, including economic corridor and energy sector.

In her presidential remarks, Vice Chancellor Dr Abida Taherani said the visit of the Chinese President to Pakistan with a cooperation deal of $46 billion that focused on a broad spectrum of cooperation and addressed core issues like energy, transport and infrastructural developments would have a greater degree of impact on the lives of people on both sides.

She said that out of 51 memoranda of understanding (MoUs), 30 were signed during the Chinese president's visit relating to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

It reflected significance of the mega project that promised people new prosperity not only for two countries, but in hitherto underdeveloped areas in Balochistan and Sindh.

Our leadership is committed to expanding relations at bilateral and multilateral levels. Today the two countries have common interests to promote regional peace and stability by eradicating terrorism, working together for peace in Afghanistan, improving relations with India and enhancing regional connectivity, she said. She added that socio-economic development of people was a common goal.

Trade volume between us reached $15 billion in 2015 and both countries have agreed to elevate trade volume up to $20 billion in the next three years. China is on top of the list of the countries having foreign direct investment in Pakistan, she said. She added that China's foreign investment inflow in July 2013-June 2014 was $695.8 million.

China's Zhejiang Normal University Vice Chancellor Dr Lou Shizhou talked about trade opportunities in Chinese city's Yiwa market and building of the Silk Road. While trade and energy corridor may be 'monumental' for Pakistan, for China it is part of more ambitious plans to beef up the country's global economic muscle, he said.

He described the corridor as a flagship project of a broader policy one belt, one road which seeks to physically connect China with Asian and European markets and beyond.

He stated that this initiative included New Silk Road which would link China with Europe through Central Asia and Maritime Silk Road to ensure a safe passage of China's shipping through the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.

He stated that this initiative could bring greater cohesion in South Asia, one of the world's least economically integrated regions.

Dr Zafar Nawaz Jaspal, Dr Noman Sattar, Chinese scholar Zhu Lingjia, Fazalur Rehman, Dr Hamadullah Kakepoto and others also spoke on the occasion.

Member countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation - China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - may be able to use Pakistani ports to get access to trade routes through the Arabian Sea once China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is completed and becomes operational.

Speaking at the Economic and Trade Ministers meeting of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Xian, the capital of China's Shaanxi province on Wednesday, Commerce Minister Khurram Dastagir Khan said that Pakistan's trade strategy focuses on developing linkages with our neighbours, leveraging our geographical location and capitalising on regional connectivity initiatives.

Pakistan has an observer status at the SCO and is scheduled to become full member state in January 2016 which will provide new impetus to Pakistan's relations with member states.

The minister emphasised that cross-border land trade is especially important for landlocked member countries as Pakistan and SCO countries will benefit substantially from greater integration through energy, commerce and transit trade.

He said that China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a landmark initiative under the umbrella of One-Belt, One-Road and this economic corridor will connect the nodes of growth centres falling between Kashgar and Gwadar.

The CPEC envisages connectivity and expansion of trade and investment through a network of roads, rail, fiber optic cables, and energy pipelines.

The commerce minister was of the view that Pakistan's geo-strategic position offers Central Asian states access to the warm waters of Arabian Sea and huge markets of South Asia.

He said that Pakistan provides critical overland routes and connectivity for mutually beneficial trade and energy transactions.

In line with the vision of the prime minister of shared prosperity through connectivity, Pakistan has undertaken several initiatives which include rebooting of Quadrilateral Agreement for Traffic in Transit (QTTA) between China, Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan and Pakistan.

The QTTA provides Pakistan a gateway to Central Asia and the landlocked Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan access to Pakistani seaports via China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

The minister said Pakistan recently acceded to TIR Convention which would ensure more efficient and faster movement of goods across our borders to the countries of Central Asia.

 China 's 'shared destiny' approach

TO sustain its growth and to extend its influence in world affairs that matches its economic success and potentials, China seems set to embark on a new phase of readjustments flowing from its global exposure.

For example, the multinational trade route project, which might help counter the country's recent economic slowdown, may have speeded up the drive to forge closer trade and economic ties with the outside world.

The launch of a grand 'One Belt, One Road' project is not atypical, but there are early signs that spell a departure from the traditional Chinese approach. The communist China's centralised style 'to decide, keep low and strictly official' seems to be changing, a China watcher said.

Take a look: China's economic illness contagious for Asia

Probably inspired by the perceived benefits and the value of social support of locals for the success of an economic project, they intend to reach out to societies and not just governments and are at least trying to be more accommodating in their interaction with other countries to reduce the trust deficit of certain key regional partners, said a retired Pakistani official who has served in China, while discussing Beijing's recent transnational projects.

The proceedings at a recent forum in China attended by the scribe did support this view. Unlike the past when China used to be content with dealing with the relevant government hierarchy, the Communist state - at the Asia Media Forum - appeared keen to build public support across the Asia Pacific region for its 'One belt, One Road' initiative.

'Probably inspired by the perceived benefits and the value of social support of locals for the success of an economic project, they (Chinese) intend to reach out to societies and not just governments'

The project, according to official Chinese position, features building a 21st century Maritime Silk Road, creating a new blueprint for maritime cooperation, a key component of the country's future development strategy.

China has product base, skill sets and technological expertise, beside many trillions of dollars' worth of savings and reserves to extend a helping hand to struggling nations with wide infrastructure deficits, to transform the economic ecosystem of the region and beyond, a participant at the forum told Dawn in Nanning, Guangxi, China.

The aim is to deepen regional integration through a free flow of trade for the collective benefit of all participating nations, added the Chinese official, who wished not to be named as he was not authorised to offer comments.

The China Daily-sponsored forum - where experts, officials and Asian News Network (ANN) members es converged - took place on September 17 in one of the greenest cities of China, Nanning, and coincided with the opening of the 12th China ASEAN Expo there. In all, representatives from 17 media groups attended the meeting.

The ban on the popular search engine Google and its allied mailing sites in China hampered the work of several journalists reporting from the forum to their readers and viewers back home. But the visit did provide them an opportunity to gain a rare insight into the life and working of the great power of the East, which has both intrigued and fascinated people across continents.

It is astonishing how little people know about the country that supplies most products, from prayer beads and mats to countless other everyday items, said a colleague from another South Asian country attending the forum.

To me, China is a big riddle. I have no clue how this top heavy centralised economy responds to market changes so swiftly, commented another journalist.

Commenting on the aim of the forum almost all speakers at the said event hammered the same theme: facilitating flow of information to 'raise awareness about 'Belt and Road initiative' and 'shared destiny' among people of the vast region.

Kang Bing, deputy editor-in-chief of China Daily, said it was crucial that the media build an 'information Silk Road'.

Mahfuz Anam, editor and publisher of Bangladesh's Daily Star, said as journalists we rejoice at the launch of the initiative and intend to follow the implementation of the plan closely.

When implementation is not fast enough or good enough, we can write critically about this. Not because we don't want it to succeed but because we want it to be very successful, he said.

Suthichai Saeyoon, founder of the Asia News Network, said the initiative would provide a platform to exchange information.

We have a role in reporting, analysing and getting out all the information that is necessary because we don't want the initiative to be confined only to the leadership, academics and bureaucrats, he said.

When approached for comment on the possibility of gaining social endorsement of locals for multiple projects of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Zhang Haizhou, assistant to the publisher at China Daily Asia Pacific, opted not to give a direct reply.

He, however, said given the scale of investment ($45bn) and the involvement of private Chinese companies in the allied CPEC projects, some Chinese think tanks have opened or in the process of opening offices in Pakistan.

The challenges to the security of Chinese people and companies in Pakistan, in particular, make it important to adopt a well-rounded approach towards the long-term economic engagement.

A retired Pakistani diplomat who spent many years in China endorsed the perception of transformation, but believed it to have been an integral part of China's strategy for the past several decades.

This is the secret of China's success. The ruling party, which led the country through painful past transitions, is cautious to jealously guard its gains but quite open to apply the wisdom acquired from others' experience to chart its future strategy, he said.

Instead of judging Western standards, Pakistanis need to try and understand the system and it's working to partake in the making of the collective future, he advised.

In a recent publication, Moody's predicted that the Silk Road Economic Belt will benefit predominately smaller states with underdeveloped economies, low investment rates and low per-capita incomes.

Zhao Baige, Chairman of RDI International think-tank project, pointed out in the speech that the seminar was a pragmatic platform for implementation of CPEC through the promotion of enterprise cooperation.

Zhao said RDI international think tank, as a new think tank platform with Chinese characteristics, pragmatic, professional and efficient, is willing to provide a full range of intellectual support and integrated services for One Belt and One Road, promote the division of labor and cooperation in enterprises going global process and improve enterprise to expand overseas business collectively.

Also it hopes to help enterprises coordinate and solve the difficulties and problems emerged in One Belt and One Road so as to further stimulate the market element dynamic and more effectively give play to the fundamental role of the market, he added.

Pakistan People's Party chief Bilawal Zardari on Friday assured Chinese President Xi Jinping that his party and country will always be behind Beijing as it climbs the ladder to become a superpower.

The young PPP leader was in the Chinese capital to attend the 'Asian Political Parties Conference on Silk Road.

' He held a meeting with the Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the conference.

The conference has been organized by the Communist Party of China and attended by more than 50 political parties and organizations from 30 countries.

Chairman Parliamentary Committee on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed represented Pakistan.

Bilawal, who participated in the conference as the PPP chief, was accompanied by his party leaders Senator Sherry Rehman and former NA deputy speaker Faisal Karim Kundi.

The PPP chief said that Pakistan and his party wanted to see China grow as a superpower and become one of the global leaders.

Bilawal's interest in China comes from his family as his grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, mother Benazir Bhutto and father Asif Ali Zardari have all been the staunch allies of Beijing in the past.

The individual meeting with the PPP chief also demonstrated warm ties as the top Chinese leadership was not scheduled to have such interaction with the participants.

Senior PPP leader Sherry Rehman told The Nation from Beijing that the meeting had a special significance as the Bhutto family was a strong advocate of close ties with China.

It was an important meeting on the sidelines of the conference.

As you know the PPP has a special place in CPC's (Communist Party of China) vision, she said.

The PPP Vice President said that Bilawal reiterated Pakistan's commitment to the One Belt, One Road CPEC initiative and asked for greater interchange connectivity between the two nations.

The PPP chief was confident the CPEC will transform Pakistan's future by creating jobs, investment in the infrastructure and energy dividends.

A PPP news release said, Both exchanged views on matters of mutual interests including people-to-people and party-to-party contacts.

Earlier, addressing the three-day conference, Bilawal said, Pakistan was among the first to welcome - and recognize - the efforts of China in reshaping the international financial architecture with new institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the New Development Bank, and the Silk Road Fund.

He said that the Silk Road, in its latest manifestation, is more than just a trade route or investment initiative that can transform regional futures; it is Beijing's great strategic bid to spur growth and prosperity in the Eurasian landmass.

He said as an avid student of Chinese growth, he had noted how over the last 20 years, China has poured in almost 9 percent of its GDP for the enhancement of domestic infrastructure.

It can teach many of us a great deal about how to build and boost transportation and communications efficiency.

In a bid for a future where the knowledge economy matters most, China has also invested in creating the world's largest broadband network.

This is no small feat, he applauded.

President Xi Jinping's assertive articulation of the One Belt-One Road vision makes it clear that the New Silk Road, both overland and maritime, will not be limited to the last century's definitions of geo-politics alone.

Whether it amounts to a Marshall Plan for the region it covers, or leaves a new footprint of soft power as it unfolds, a world hungry for partnering in leadership should welcome it, he added.

The PPP leader said that the Chinese vision for human security, economic cooperation, reform and joint prosperity, lies at the heart of international solutions to the turmoil and chaos the world was facing.

Sherry Rehman in her speech stressed the need for economic integration and political unity.

These should be our national goals, she emphasised.

Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday said the Russian side has expressed willingness to collaborate with the Chinese side to achieve early completion of the 1100-kilometer North South pipeline project.

We would be happy if such collaboration can be achieved, the minister remarked while talking to a delegation of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).

Talking to the Chinese delegation, the minister said that the country was currently developing three major projects including Gawadar-Nawabshah pipeline project with help of China, TAPI project, whose groundbreaking was expected next month, and North South pipeline project.

He said Pakistan would welcome to have joint venture on gas pipelines projects with China and the latter could collaborate with regard to North South pipeline project which was being executed as part of agreement between Pakistan and Russia.

It is pertinent to mention here that an intergovernmental agreement for the construction of NorthSouth LNG pipeline was signed last month between Russia and Pakistan. The 1,100 kilometer North South pipeline with a capacity of 12.4bcm per annum will connect Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals located in Karachi with Lahore. The project will be executed by a Russian company RTGlobal Resources a part of Russia State Corporation Rostec.

The minister said that the government was pursuing a multi-pronged strategy to meet the country's growing energy needs and the relevant policies were advancing attractive incentives for investors to pump in their resources for achieving good benefits, he added.

He said that the government offered good opportunities for investment in energy sector as the country was blessed with abundant natural resources.

Abbasi said in Pakistan success ratio for exploration of hydrocarbon resources was high, thus, the CNPC could inject investment into upstream oil and gas sector, venturing into exploration activities either independently or through joint venture with state owned OGDCL and PPL following concession of blocks to it under government to government arrangements.

We appreciate the company interest in upstream exploration, investment in petroleum related manufacturing, development of pipeline projects, up-gradation of existing petroleum related infrastructure and technology and petro-chemical area, he added.

He said there was a lot of potential for investment in all these areas and there was suitable time for the delegation to visit at a time when development projects were taking pace. He also offered for investment offshore sector which he added still was lying unexplored and the CNPC could go into the sector to have good incentives and attractive price for gas, he added.

He said industrial parks would be important projects and could be regional production and supply center. He said this projects would assist the government and people of Pakistan to participate in the development of 'One Belt, One Road' project.

Wang Shihong, board member and assistant president of CNPC who is leading the delegation, appreciated the Pakistani government for facilitating and extending its support.

He also briefed about the company's profile saying it was the fourth largest oil company and was running 91 oil and gas projects in 35 countries. He said the purpose of the visit was to explore mutually beneficial avenues of cooperation in energy sector including oil and gas exploration, production, oil and gas field development, manufacturing steel pipelines, process plants, oil refinery equipment, laying gas pipelines etc.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Resources Jam Kamal said the CNPC, in addition to other areas, could also go into refinery sector of the country which needed to have adequate oil production.

The meeting was attended by senior officials of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources and Inter State Gas Company.

A high ranking official of Chinese military Thursday rejected New Delhi's concerns about China encircling India by enhancing capability of Pakistan's armed forces through high-tech equipment and weapons as 'unnecessary and baseless'.

This is unnecessary and baseless concern, said Rear Admiral Guanyoufei, Director General Foreign Affairs, Ministry of National Defence, in a press briefing about the visit of a high level Chinese Military delegation to Pakistan headed by Vice Chairman of Central Military Commission, General Fan Changlong.

The CPEC project being built under 'one belt one road' policy would benefit all the regional countries including India, Admiral Guanyoufei said when asked for his comment about India's concerns over China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and China's providing eight high tech submarines to Pakistan.

When asked about contribution being made by China in CPEC security, the official said it was under discussion between militaries of Pakistan and China, adding China will meet all the necessary requirements.

Sharing details about the activities of General Fan Changlong's delegation, Admiral Guanyoufei said the delegation had a series of meetings with Pakistan's top civil and military leaders and appreciated Pakistan's role in counterterrorism.

He said both the 'iron brothers' (China and Pakistan) have agreed on a number of issues to further advance their all-weather strategic partnership.

This is the first visit of Vice Chairman of Central Military Commission of China after a lapse of 11 years.

Welcoming General Changlong to Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said that friendship with China is the cornerstone of his country's foreign policy as both the countries enjoy unparalleled relations in the contemporary world.

He said the time-tested friendship between the two countries is based on strong mutual trust, cooperation and convergence of views on regional and global issues.

Speaking on the occasion General Changlong said, The mutually supportive cooperation in the field of defence is a critical factor in maintaining peace and stability in the region.

General Changlong also called on Chief of Army Staff General Raheel Sharif in Rawalpindi and discussed matters of mutual interest, regional security, steps for regional stability and enhanced bilateral defence collaboration.

General Raheel said Pak-China relations are all-weather and based on mutual trust and cooperation.

He said this relationship has survived the test of times and is only bound to grow.

General Fan Changlong said China and Pakistan are the best brothers, good friends and strategic partners.

We share the tradition of mutual understanding, mutual trust and mutual support.

China deeply appreciates the determination of Pakistan Army in counterterrorism and the successful operation in various fields, he said.

He said CPEC is equally beneficial to both China and Pakistan.

He lauded the efforts made by Pakistan Army for safeguarding the CPEC.

We look forward to close cooperation with Pakistan side to ensure proper management and security of CPEC.

Earlier on his arrival, the Chinese General laid floral wreath at Yadgar-e-Shuhada and paid rich tribute to the martyrs.

Vice Chairman of Central Military Commission China also called on Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Rashad Mahmood.

Both sides reaffirmed the resolve to further enhance cooperation between the two Armed Forces.

The delegation also called on Air Chief and will meet Pakistan's naval chief on Friday.

CPEC -Invigorating the national maritime sector

On August 12, 1973, the National Assembly elected Zulfiquar Ali Bhutto as the country's Prime Minster. A month later, on September 19, the elected Prime Minster arrived at the White House on a state visit. In warmly greeting the visitor, President Nixon declared, 'the independence and integrity of Pakistan is a cornerstone of American foreign policy'. In his talks, the Prime Minister of Pakistan sought US help to construct a new port at Gwadar, on the Arabian Sea coast of thinly populated Balochistan. Although Nixon responded that he would have the proposal examined carefully, his National Security Council briefing paper indicated no great interest in having a facility in Balochistan which would stir up the Soviets, the Indians and the Afghans without greatly contributing to the U.S. interests. The administration took no action on the proposal which China's Premier Zhou Enlai strongly seconded when Kissinger visited China in November 1973.

Over four decades later, the geo-politics in the Indian Ocean are witnessing a complete reversal. China has turned that sobering counsel given to the United States in its own favour. With the latter now firmly locked in strategic alliance with India, China finds a tremendous opportunity in Gwadar and through it access to the maritime highways of the Indian Ocean.

The China -Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is part of China's massive 'One Belt One Road' (OBOR) transcontinental and transoceanic initiative. Via a network of rail road and motorways envisioned under the CPEC, the port of Gwadar will connect China with Central Asia, Africa, Middle East and Europe. It will economically uplift China's western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang which remain largely underdeveloped compared to eastern provinces. Through the Corridor, China also circumvents the Strait of Malacca, a major conduit of Beijing's oil imports. Of the 6.1 million bbl/d of oil that China currently consumes, nearly 52 percent (3.2 million bbl/d) is supplied by Middle East, duly shipped through sealines in the western Indian Ocean.

The CPEC is a windfall opportunity for Pakistan's unattended maritime sector. With the issue of continental shelf now resolved favourably, Pakistan has a positive chance to conduct marine scientific research in the 290,000 sq km of sea area under its jurisdiction. The Chief of the Naval Staff is the principal advisor to the government of Pakistan on maritime related matters. A committee comprising of representatives from all shades of national maritime sector must be promptly constituted under the Chief of the Naval Staff. The committee should identify possible areas in the sector that can be invigorated in collaboration with Chinese assistance. The final recommendations could then be presented before the Senate Standing Committee on CPEC before being taken up with the Chinese government. The effort to galvanise maritime sector could be easily made an adjunct part of CPEC.

An extensive mapping and oceanographic survey of our maritime zones including sea bed is already overdue. This can now be undertaken jointly with China. Key modalities could be worked out at higher level between the two governments' along with appropriate strategy for exploitation, sustainable development as well as profit sharing. The process however must take into consideration the concerns of Balochistan. Both Pakistan and China have fairly modern oceangoing survey vessels in their inventory. Our national and coastal economy is greatly tied to the sea. The latter supports a large local community in Balochistan and Sindh that dwells along Pakistan's 990 km long coastline.

The hitherto lackluster performance of National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) too needs to be revitalized with the support of Chinese and local marine science expertise. A true and sustainable exploitation of Pakistan's maritime zones based on genuine scientific research will yield rich dividends for the country in terms of living, non-living resources as well as minerals like oil and gas hydrates.

Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) is the only Public Sector Enterprise showing profit since around 2002. Despite that, PNSC lifts only a trifling percentage of national cargo. It is noteworthy to mention that bulk of Pakistan's sea based cargo is transported via foreign carriers draining about US $ 3.5 billion annually. The corporation accordingly needs to be injected with a fresh lease of life. The government must consider setting up at least one to two shipyards at Gwadar as part of infrastructure under CPEC. New ships to lift national cargo could be constructed in local yards with Chinese assistance. Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works (KSEW) is the only shipyard and oldest heavy engineering establishment in Pakistan catering for shipbuilding, ship repair and general heavy engineering.

Lastly, with CPEC maturing, the maritime commercial traffic will rise in the region and so will the responsibility and task of the Pakistan Navy. Both, PN and PLA Navy must devise and formulate a long term strategy to guard their maritime interests in the region.

The success of CPEC will however depend on Pakistan's political resolve, addressing the concerns of marginalized population over and above revisiting its foreign policy that readjusts to the developing geo-politics in the Indian Ocean.

PPP flays Punjab-centric CPEC

The Pakistan People's Party on Friday asked Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to address stakeholders' reservations over the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.

Some political parties with stakes in smaller provinces have been raising voice against alleged change in the original route of CPEC to the advantage of Punjab.

Now, PPP's Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Syed Khurshid Shah has formally sought Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's intervention to address these reservations, alleging that Sindh was being neglected 'on purpose'.

CPEC consists of a package of Chinese infrastructure investments in Pakistan worth $46 billion, and is the flagship project of China's Belt and Road development framework.

The mega development project, which consists of a 2,000 mile transportation corridor of roads, railways and pipelines, will connect the Chinese-operated Pakistani port of Gwadar at the Arabian Sea with the Chinese province of Xinjiang.

CPEC, expected to be ready in 15 years, will eventually extend to other countries, hopefully stimulating an economic boom in the region.

The government earlier said it was ready to show 'flexibility' and accept nationalist parties' demands on CPEC routes if they can prove that changes have been made to the original plan.

It says the parties keep criticising the government on alleged route change but none of them has been able to pinpoint the modification.

Opposition Leader in the National Assembly however has written a letter to the prime minister seeking his intervention to address the reservations on route of the project.

Khurshid Shah, who belongs to PPP that rules Sindh, said that if the corridor would benefit one province more than others, it would add problems to the historic agreement between the neighbours (Pakistan and China).

The opposition leader termed the CPEC a 'lifetime opportunity' for Pakistan.

He warned Nawaz Sharif of negative outcomes of unequal benefit distribution among the provinces.

The letter states that Sindh was intentionally being neglected and demanded the premier make efforts for benefit of the entire country with the massive investment that China was making.

Reservations of all the stakeholders must be addressed, Shah wrote.

On Friday, the opposition walked out of the Senate against government's irresponsible attitude.

The protesters had expected an answer from the government regarding their reservations.

Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party's Usman Khan Kakkar said that not a single project has been announced on the western route of the corridor - that runs through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Experts believe that the planned Gwadar-Kashgar railway link will spur further rail development in Central Asia, including a possible railway from Kashgar through Kyrgyzstan to Andijan in Uzbekistan.

On completion, CPEC will also offer an economic stimulus to China's underdeveloped western provinces, including Xinjiang, by opening their markets to global competition, thereby reducing their income gap with China's developed coastal cities and provinces.

The broader infrastructural development of the Silk Road Economic Belt will likewise stimulate the economies of Central Asia by opening greater access to regional markets, including those of the Caspian and Caucasus regions.

When complete, CPEC's pipelines from Gwadar to Xinjiang will offer the shortest route for China to import oil and gas from Africa and the Middle East.

The railways and highways to be constructed under the CPEC plan will also offer Chinese traders an important overland shortcut between China and Europe, and could cut travelling time and costs by half, compared to the current shipping routes utilising the crowded and increasingly risky Straits of Malacca.

CPEC also provides for infrastructure for the digital economy, as it will include a $44 million fibre optic cable connecting Xinjiang with Rawalpindi.

China also plans over $10 billion in infrastructure investments in Pakistan outside of the CPEC framework.

These include a six-lane 1,240km expressway between Karachi and Lahore which is scheduled for completion in 2017, modernisation of 1,300km Karakoram Highway between China and Pakistan across the Himalayas, and upgrades to public transportation in Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi, and three other cities.

Seeking foreign investment

AN international seminar on business opportunities organised by the Punjab government on November 6-7 offered an opportunity to foreign and local businessmen and investors to have frank and candid discussions on investment avenues in the province and explore areas for possible cooperation.

They ended up signing about 150 MoUs and agreements.

Following the improvement of the security situation, there is a discernible turnaround in business sentiments - a fact that has been acknowledged by international financial institutions, ratings agencies and fund managers.

Known as the land of five rivers, Punjab is the most populous, industrialised and developed province of Pakistan, with a population of 100m. Agriculture forms the core of the provincial economy.

Punjab's share in the country's large- and small-scale manufacturing is 39.2pc and 70pc respectively. On the whole, Punjab's imprint on the national economy is significant.

The province has a large middle class with high purchasing power. The English-speaking youth, who happen to be graduates of top national and international universities, provide readily available and qualified human resource.

Punjab has identified 48 key projects worth $6.56bn

Punjab offers the most lucrative, secure and productive investment opportunities across different sectors such as infrastructure, mines and minerals, transport, industrial estates, housing and energy. It has made an effective investment policy framework that has been developed from the perspective of the investors.

The chief reason Punjab takes a lead when it comes to attracting foreign direct investment in Pakistan is that it has identified 48 key projects worth $6.56bn. The province has the systems that support transparency and fair competition, the infrastructural spine that will network all connectivity needs, and the workforce that has the skill and drive to make a difference in a competitive market.

The government is also committed to protect foreign and local investment with guaranteed and reasonable rates of return, coupled with high liquidity and no restriction on the movement of capital.

The Punjab Growth Strategy 2018 aims to make the province a secure, economically vibrant, industrialised and knowledge-based province, which is prosperous and competitive. The strategy aims to grow the provincial economy by creating favourable conditions for private investment. Besides focusing on reforms and the development of key sectors of the economy, it offers solutions to key challenges like underutilised manufacturing capacity, energy shortages, exports, unemployment, low productivity and skill shortages.

Energy continues to be a critical area for the success of investment ventures. There is no denying that 2-3pc of GDP is lost per annum owing to the worst energy crisis - a problem that needs to be tackled expeditiously.

The government introduced a National Power Policy that addresses all the facets of the energy crisis. There is a need to focus on broadening the energy mix by tapping all available resources, such as hydropower, coal, solar, wind, LNG and biomass. If all things go right, by the time the projects mature, enough electricity will be available to cater to the requirements of the growing economy.

The $46bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is President Xi Jinping's flagship initiative 'One Belt One Road'. Poised to connect Gwadar Port in southwest Pakistan with China's northwest Xinjiang region, the corridor will have a huge network of highways, railways, industrial zones and pipelines to transport oil and gas.

About $36bn of the package will be spent on energy-sector development. Under CPEC, hydropower, coal, wind and solar projects will add a total of 10,400MW to the national grid. A Pakistan-centred road network will facilitate contacts between Pakistan's neighbours on east and west, while the corridor will bring closer integration within regional economies.

The CPEC is a game-changer with the potential to transform Pakistan's socioeconomic landscape, creating an enormous investment potential.

Punjab has all the ingredients for profitable investment in different sectors of its economy. A liberal investment regime is in place, which is complemented by a geographical advantage and a huge consumer market.

The basic principles of the province's investment policy are: reducing the cost of doing business; cutting the process of doing business; and facilitating businesses with the creation of industrial clusters and special economic zones.

As presentations at the seminar made clear, Punjab offers the most attractive and secure return on investment. By holding the seminar, the government made a strong case for investment in energy, housing, mines and minerals, infrastructure, transport and industrial sectors.

It also focused on the transfer of expertise and management skills to expedite the process of development and fresh business ideas and technology to foster growth in the province.

Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) director general Ambassador Masood Khan on Thursday advised the government to invest in expanding relations with various countries, instead of getting bogged down by conflicts and controversies.

Mr Khan, who was chairing the concluding session of the First Islamabad Regional Forum, launched by the Pakistan-China Institute in cooperation with Konrad Adeneaur Stiftung (KAS), said that promoting relations with other countries based on national interest was not a zero-sum game.

He cautioned against being too selected in foreign policy operations, and said that the US and China, despite their strong differences, also have a lot of convergences. The same, he said, was true of US and Russia.

This is no Cold War era, he said.

Mr Khan said that it was worrying that India had closed down all the avenues of dialogue with Pakistan. He said that growing extremism in India was problematic for the region and a threat to liberal, secular and moderate forces there.

The ISSI head called for a closer reading of global trends marked by globalization, interdependence, drift to conflict and the development of ICTs and regionalism.

Mr Khan also suggested the Pakistan focus on getting its economic 'house' in order. The geostrategic important will take care of itself, he said.

Earlier, while inaugurating the forum, Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal urged South Asian countries to learn from the EU model, about the benefits of cooperation and the dangers of conflict and confrontation.

Senate Defence Committee and Parliamentary Committee on CPEC chairperson Senator Mushahid Hussain said the mistakes made by the world powers in the past should not be repeated.

He said these mistakes include the invasion of Iraq, the Indo-US civil-nuclear deal for political reasons, and the West and some Arab states' insistence of regime change in Syria instead of tackling the terrorism and extremism responsible for the current turmoil and instability.

During a session on 'Pakistan and China: Changing Regional Scenario', panelists spoke on the rise of China and its implications for the Islamic word, the Chinese perspective on the One Belt, One Road initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Doors to the world of folk puppetry swung wide open to the public on Friday morning as the three-day 15th National Folk Puppet Festival kicked off here at the Rafi Peer Cultural Center, Raiwind Road.

The inaugural ceremony was colourful; hundreds of pigeons and balloons were left in the air. The mascot dance and music added spice to folk art and craft, also part of the festival. More than 1,500 children from five schools attended the ceremony and they were excited to see puppets of different sizes.

A number of visitors also toured the International Museum of Puppetry which was founded by Faizan Pirzada under the banner of the Rafi Peer Theatre Workshop over a decade ago.

The opening of the festival featured an amazing collection of puppets. A music performance by Krishan Lal Bheel and group, who represents known Cholistani folk singing tradition of Bheels, will be the regular feature of the festival every night.

The event would be quite informative for the puppetry fanciers in terms of new techniques and different kinds of hand-held and string puppets. The festival would host folk puppeteers each of whom has distinguished himself in the field of puppetry through training, entertainment and bringing innovations in the art.

This year, Rafi Peer has invited puppeteers such as Bahadar Ali, Bashir Dhamali, Abdul Aziz, Abid Ali, Muhammad Jamil and Muhammad Bashir to showcase their talent along with the Pakistan National Council of Arts, the Alhamra Puppet Theatre and Asghar Bahawalpuri.

The National Folk Puppet Festival is a project of the Museum of Puppetry and is meant to safeguard and promote the struggling art of folk puppetry.

The festival takes place at a critical time in our country, said Saadan Pirzada, the creative director. He said what one sees today are protests, terrorism and economic recession and the RPTW battles all odds and continues with its social responsibility in its mission of supporting culture in Pakistan.

With no corporate patronage left for such events, it finds its role more important than ever before. It is with this decision that they continue their mission, through festivals and events, aiming to celebrate the true spirit of our culture, he said.

Exhibition: An exhibition of paintings, titled 'One Belt, One Road' by a leading Chinese artist, Pan Shiqiang, opened at the Punjab Institute of Language Art and Culture on Friday.

The exhibition is a part of the international cultural communications between China and Pakistan.

Mr Shiqiang is the vice president of the Chinese Industry Union Cultural Art Committee. His works have been collected by art international institutions.

With the help of an interpreter, he told Dawn the artworks on display were his recent work. He said he was a self-taught artist.

Pilac Director Dr Sughra Sadaf held the exhibition in high esteem and said China and Pakistan were great friends, adding that the exhibition had artworks that represented culture and history of China. The exhibition will remain open for three days.


 

 

 China 's most powerful weapon is trade

THIS ought to have been an excruciatingly embarrassing time for Najib Razak, Malaysia's scandal-engulfed prime minister, to meet the leaders of the free and not-quite-so free world. The development fund he helped set up, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, is linked with multiple international probes into suspicious transactions. Weighed down by $11bn in debt, it is fighting to stay afloat.

Instead, Mr Najib, fresh from the glow of finding $700m from an unnamed Middle Eastern donor in his personal bank account, appeared to relish the chance of hosting the US president and Chinese premier, both of whom were in Kuala Lumpur last week to attend regional gatherings.

As well he might. Barack Obama, who badly needs Mr Najib to support a broad agenda, from counter-terrorism to free trade, went decidedly easy on a leader who stands accused of misappropriating state funds on a massive scale. Among other things, Mr Obama praised Malaysia as being 'extraordinarily helpful' in fighting Isis with a counter-narrative of moderate Islam. He also acknowledged Malaysia's importance as a signatory of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact that Washington hopes will bind it to the world's most dynamic region and complement its much-discussed (though not-so-much enacted) military pivot to the Pacific.

Li Keqiang, the Chinese leader, went one better. He showered Mr Najib with gifts - as if $700m was not enough. State-owned China General Nuclear Power Group coughed up $2.3bn to buy energy assets belonging to 1MDB, thereby relieving its debt misery. Mr Li talked glowingly about the potential for other big Chinese investments, including a planned high-speed rail link from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. The two traded purchases in each other's debt as lovers might trade poems.

This sort of soft commercial tussle, though less headline-grabbing than scraps over artificial islands in the South China Sea, may turn out to be more significant. If Washington has the TPP, Beijing has the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership

The usual view of China's rise is that it presents Asian countries with a tough choice. How, for example, should Australia balance its commercial interests with China, by far its biggest trading partner, against its deep security interests with the US? The answer is that it is not always easy. Australia, whose 24 years of recession-free growth owes much to China's hitherto voracious demand for commodities, has a sometimes tetchy relationship with its economic benefactor. Sydney has been wary about Chinese investments in farmland, telecommunications and minerals.

Yet for less well-off countries there may be an alternative: play one off against the other for the best possible deal. A case in point is Pakistan. An on-again, off-again ally of Washington, Islamabad has consistently stuck close to Beijing. It has been rewarded with the promise of huge investments in its rickety power and transport sectors. China has talked grandiosely of building an 1,800 mile-long corridor linking Pakistan's deep-sea port at Gwadar to its own restless Xinjiang region. If even a fraction of the $46bn Beijing has flashed comes good, it could be transformative.

Indonesia, too, has been canny. Recently, it played off China against not the US but Japan. After years of talking to Tokyo about a $5bn bullet train, at the last minute Jakarta took the Chinese shilling. Beijing offered a financing deal too good to pass up. Wrongfooted Japanese diplomats promised to redouble efforts to win the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore rail link also in Beijing's sights.

This sort of soft commercial tussle, though less headline-grabbing than scraps over artificial islands in the South China Sea, may turn out to be more significant. If Washington has the TPP, Beijing has the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. The US has the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Now Beijing has the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which could start funding projects next year.

Beijing's trump card may be its One Belt, One Road plan to link China to Europe and the Middle East via railways, roads and ports spanning central Asia and the Pacific and Indian oceans. For the multiple countries that lie along those routes, from Myanmar and Kazakhstan to Indonesia and Sri Lanka, there is money and concrete to be had. And money talks. Even the UK is not immune to the pull of China's red dollar.

Money can only buy you so much. Myanmar, Sri Lanka and the Philippines have each resisted the gravitational pull of China. Myanmar's political reform and overtures to Washington were driven by the generals' fear of being beholden to Beijing. Sri Lanka's voters kicked out former president Mahinda Rajapaksa because he was seen to have cosied up too closely to China. And the Philippines has put its security concerns ahead of its economic ones, risking Chinese wrath (and banana boycotts) by taking Beijing to international court over a sovereignty dispute.

Yet the battle is on for the hearts and minds of Asia. It will be won as much by engineers as by military strategists.

Asia's special economic zones receiving more FDI

Special Economic Zones (SEZs) can be a driving force for increased trade, investment and economic reforms in Asia, says a new Asian Development Bank report.

Expansion in the number of SEZs from about 500 in 1995 to over 4,300 in 2015 shows the strong and rising interest to this form of policy experiment, though the success record is somewhat mixed, said ADB Chief Economist Shang-Jin Wei in `The Asian Economic Integration Report 2015.'

The number of SEZs in an economy is positively related to overall export performance in Asia. The report also finds that in developing Asia, countries with SEZs attract significantly more FDI, with the existence of SEZs corresponding to 82 per cent greater FDI levels.

However, there have also been failures, with a lack of strategic focus and regulatory and governance gaps undermining performance in some cases.

The report notes that for zones to become a major driver of development, they must be made an integral part of a government's national development strategy and industrial policy.

The data shows that Asia's income elasticity of trade declined from 2.69 before the global financial crisis to 1.30 afterwards and the value of Asia's intermediate goods trade-almost 60pc of total trade - contracted 2.6 per cent in 2014.

The report also outlines how Asia has become an important source of outbound investment, with FDI outflows outstripping inflows, growing over 45pc between 2010 and 2014.

Increased investment was led by traditional investors, including Japan, Hong Kong, China and Singapore and also emerging Asian investors, such as the PRC, India, Malaysia and Thailand.

Asia remains the world's largest source of international migrants, accounting for a third of the global total in 2013, and the region also accounted for nearly 50pc of global remittances in 2014.

In South Asia, most FDI inflows go to India and Pakistan. By sector, India's manufacturing is gaining, as policies to revitalise the sector are sustained.

The increase in FDI inflows in Pakistan came from rising flows in services, in particular a large investment made by the China Mobile in telecommunications. In addition, Pakistan will benefit significantly from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and associated investment in infrastructure and manufacturing-in the overall context of implementing the China's One Belt, One Road strategy.

In 2013-2014, South Asia absorbed 24 per cent of all Asia's inflows globally -- against Southeast Asia's 11pc -- due to increased equity inflows to India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.

Today, the whole nation is mourning over the saddest tragedy in the history of Pakistan - the terrorists' attack on Army Public School Peshawar.

The school was attacked by Taliban terrorists on 16 December 2014. More than 140 people including about 132 children were killed before the army commandos stormed into the campus building and killed all seven attackers.

The sacrifices of the children of Army Public School Peshawar gave new courage and determination in the war against terrorism, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif said on Tuesday. The debt of their blood will be repaid by completely eliminating terrorists, the chief minister said in his message on the first anniversary of APS Peshawar attack.

Shahbaz Sharif said the sacrifices of APS martyrs will be remembered forever. December 16 shocked the entire nation. This day can never be forgotten.

The CM said that entire nation has united in the war against terrorism and a decisive war has been started for purging the motherland of terrorists.

He vowed that the government will not rest content till elimination of last terrorist. Every Pakistani from Peshawar to Karachi was grieved over the tragic incident of terrorism. The beasts trying to promote ignorance cannot stop the children from getting education through such cowardly acts.

He said that thousands of Pakistanis have sacrificed their lives in the war against terrorism so far which include officers and personnel of Pak army and police.

Shahbaz Sharif vowed that extremism and terrorism will be eliminated forever and a safe and peaceful Pakistan will be given to new generation. This is thewar for survival of coming generations, said the CM, expressing the hope that 18 crore people of Pakistan will win the war against terrorism.

He added: On this day, we have to renew our determination to maintain this unity in the war against terrorists for which innocent children have sacrificed their lives.

There is no room for terrorism and extremism in the Pakistan of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and establishment of Pakistani society based on tolerance and moderation is our mission and we will certainly achieve this great objective of Quaid-e-Azam.

CM hails China over cooperation: Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif has said that China holds significant importance in promoting regional cooperation.

The platform of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) can also play a role for the development of the region as well, the chief minister told the media in Chinese city of Zhengzhou yesterday. It is imperative that that all member countries of the SCO should make collective efforts for the development of the region and further promote regional cooperation, he said.

Shahbaz Sharif said Pak-China relations are touching new heights and the bilateral ties between the two countries have strengthened during the tenure of the PML-N government. Work is in progress on several projects of power generation in Pakistan with the cooperation of China to cope with the shortage of electricity while projects for generation of energy under China Pakistan Economic Corridor are also being implemented speedily.

He added that full attention was being paid to energy sector and thousands of megawatts electricity would be added to the national grid with the completion of a number of power projects by the end of 2017. Following the vision of Chinese President One belt, one road, work is being carried out for the promotion of regional contacts under China Pakistan Economic Corridor.

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will usher in a new era of progress and prosperity in Pakistan as well as the region, the CM said, adding that new avenues of relation have opened between China and Pakistan and the ties between the two countries will be taken to new heights.

THE prime minister chose the occasion of the 14th meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation heads of government in Henan, China, to reiterate his government's commitment to greater regional ties with its neighbourhood to the north.

The remarks focused on identifying common values and regional cooperation to reap economic benefits, as well as to strengthen each country's commitment to the fight against the forces of disorder and conflict that are a threat to state sovereignty and territorial integrity everywhere.

The remarks are welcome, as well as the larger vision that they derive from. Greater cooperation among neighbouring states on infrastructure and energy, as well as connectivity and broader developmental goals, can go a long way to strengthen their own capacities to withstand challenges to their sovereignty and deliver on promises to their citizenry.

Pakistan's support for the 'one belt, one road' initiative being advanced by China is well known, and its potential to boost the framework for growth in the country is equally well understood.

But it will take more than resolve to realise the vision and take it beyond just a statement of intent. First order of business ought to be ensuring a consensus within Pakistan, and not repeating the mistakes of the past, when foreign assistance in critical infrastructure projects ran aground on the myriad dissensions that are the hallmark of our democracy.

This is a fragile task, and it will take skilful politics to navigate. Second order of business must be to ensure that Pakistan's own interests have been properly safeguarded when negotiating the terms of the country's integration into a regional matrix.

We have a history of making such decisions in an emotional manner, and that mistake ought to be avoided. Third, and equally importantly, polite suggestions to consider broadening the participation in this regional matrix to neighbours east and west ought to be entertained with seriousness, and again without emotion.

Regional connectivity and cooperation yields its benefits with growing generosity with a larger number of partners, and Pakistan's location holds far greater promise than can be envisioned through a geopolitical lens.

Realising the vision contained in the prime minister's remarks is a tougher challenge than many realise.

Yet it is quite possibly the single greatest guarantor of our future growth and prosperity. It is important to not let it devolve to the lowest common denominator, where Pakistan becomes little more than a road for other people's commerce.

China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is the stimulus that the Pakistan economy needs for rapid growth, said Minister for Planning and Development.

Ahsan Iqbal gave the keynote talk at an event held on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. He said that the CPEC initiative and the large investment boost that it brings is a special achievement of the PML-N government. He said that not only will CPEC investment boost our economy, but will create synergies for continued sustained growth. He dealt with many of the issues raised in various fora regarding transparency of CPEC projects, selection of routes on the CPEC alignment, and implementation issues with CPEC projects. Ahsan Iqbal also shared details of the expected foreign assistance due for CPEC projects.

Earlier, in his opening comments, Chairman Institute for Policy Reforms, Humayun Akhtar Khan said that CPEC has received wide attention, but given its importance, needed in depth discussion. He requested that government elaborate upon project completion timelines, their financing plan, and strategy for effective implementation. He said that connection between markets, both within the country and with the region, would change the fundamentals of doing business in Pakistan and in the region.

In an overview of CPEC, Ashraf Hayat, Executive Director IPR, said CPEC has the potential to bring fundamental changes to the Pakistan economy. Looking at the broader One Belt One Road initiative, he said that it would connect about sixty countries through a complex network of roads, rails, ports, and oil pipelines. He said that IPR supported CPEC. His comments were to enhance the effectiveness of the programme. A major share of the $46 billion was for power projects to be implemented in the private sector. He requested information on how many of these projects had achieved financial close or are near financial close. He said that these projects should have been under construction if these are to become operational by 2018.

He shared financial progress of projects to be financed from public sector funds. He felt that allocations made so far seemed low. Government must balance between the competing objectives of fiscal deficit limits placed under the IMF programme and additional spending of about Rs 200 billion annually on CPEC projects. What are government's plans to ensure timely financing of these projects? Government may also elaborate on the extent of economic assistance expected for CPEC projects and the terms of these loans. So far, government's PSDP showed that foreign assistance was well below the numbers stated.

He requested to know how government planned to ensure sustainability of external debt obligations. He said that by 2020, CPEC would add 3 billion dollars to Pakistan's already high debt repayment. Total repayment obligation would reach $10 billion. Pakistan's current account deficit would also increase because of increase in power machinery and repatriation of IPP profits. He said that CPEC projects were extremely important, but to ensure sustained growth, government must have plans. He also stressed upon the need for transparency in CPEC implementation both in terms of information sharing and in government procurement decisions.

Deputy Chief of Mission of the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad reiterated the commitment of the Chinese government to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor. He said that this bilateral relationship will further deepen and would strengthen Pakistan and the region.

In his closing comments, renowned economist Dr Hafiz Pasha, Managing Director IPR, elaborated on the macro-economic and operational implications of CPEC implementation. He said that that these projects are critical for Pakistan and that IMF must be told accordingly.

THE great thing about the road is that we can go wherever we want. The problem is that others come here on it too, said an old man in Islamkot in Thar desert, lamenting the intrusion of modernity. With the road came the coal developers, the land grabbers, madressahs and maulvis, divisive politicians, strangers with guns and too much money, outsiders who ogled at women, and NGOs who said everything they did was wrong. But it also brought mobile phone coverage, easier access to healthcare and labour markets, convenient transport and a sense of connection with the nation-state.

Like all other symbols of modernity from schools to vaccinations and from dams to television, initial scepticism and contestation gives way to grudging acceptance by most, as long as some version of initial purity can be preserved, usually through women's bodies. Like the other symbols, roads have a power, maybe even a route beyond what was initially conceptualised.

The silk route, for instance, was born of the search for 'heavenly horses'. The Chinese Han dynasty wanted horses from Ferghana valley, which they heard ran so fast they sweated blood and that could defeat the Huns against whom the Great Wall had been constructed. The blood sweat turned out to be parasites that burst equine capillaries. But in the search for horses, they found markets for silk.

And now the silk route is being revived. China's ambition is staggering. The contiguous land route from China will cross Central Asian states through to Iran and Turkey, then via Ukraine to Moscow, onto Germany, Portugal and Italy. From there waterway connections will bridge to Greece, down Lebanon into Ethiopia and Kenya, crossing the oceans through Sri Lanka and Malaysia and looping back into China. Collectively known as the OBOR (One Belt One Road) Initiative, it would link two-thirds of the world's population and two-thirds of known energy reserves. The Gwadar to Kashgar route is one of three corridors that will connect the land route with the sea route. All the current government here seems to have extracted from this proposed economic recalibration of the world is that transport is the new in thing.

CPEC is not only a road. It is seen as the cure for all national ills.

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is coalescing tribal, local, ethnic, national and international regimes into specific GPS coordinates while throwing forward interesting anomalies. Roads are usually a public good and public works, but this one is a foreign investment with foreign contractors. It follows the narrative of economic development but the contestation around it is built on psycho-geography. It is being heralded as a trigger of growth but with little thought of what we will produce and send out through the corridor aside from it being a transit facility, a regional laari adda.

But it is not only a road. It is energy projects, industrial parks, exports, economic growth and the cure for all national ills. Like the honey that grandmothers say is the remedy for everything. Drawing from the Egyptians, maybe we think this honey can embalm ethnic grievances. So it is definitely not just a road.

But then, it never is. The women of Kaka Pir village, now known as Sandspit in Karachi, say the construction of the road that connected their village, Manora island and the city in the 1950s changed their lives. It opened up jobs, sure. But it changed the social fabric from a matrilocal village where women went on fishing expeditions, made nets and swam in the mangroves to one where they are confined to their homes because of the fear of outsiders. Instruments of modernity act upon existing social differences and exacerbate them. Including roads. Including, in fact, the state itself.

In Telangana in India, there is an infamous 'highway of death' that with its road accidents has created entire villages of widows along its route because no one thought of making ways for villager pedestrians to cross it. It could work as an analogy for what development can mean if it doesn't factor in the poor and disenfranchised. That's what the bypasses end up bypassing.

When cement structures became common, the Odh tribe in lower Sindh who made mud houses became redundant and ended up as bonded laborers. More recently, when their property became prime real estate, katchi abadi dwellers in Islamabad were recast first as Afghan Pakhtuns who threatened security, and then as Christians who threatened the Muslim credentials of the city and in either case required eviction. Development creates its own collateral damage.

The old man in Islamkot was among the crowd that stood on the road to receive the dead bodies of five labourers from his village who had gone to Turbat to work on Sohrab dam and were killed by Baloch militants. You can decide what goes on the road, he said, But you can't stop what comes on it.

The world's most important partnership

Our two countries' multi-faceted cooperation is in our peoples' fundamental interests and is a conscious historic choice. We will continue our close coordination on regional and international issues.

-President Vladimir Putin, March 22, 2013, on President Xi Jinping's first visit to Russia.

President Vladimir Putin's first meeting with his Chinese Counterpart Xi Jin Ping set the pace of the relationship where both communist powers decided to sink their teeth into one of the most important partnerships of the 21st century.

With bilateral trade and investment enhancing rapidly from $5 billion in 1990s to $100 billion in 2014 coupled with energy collaborations including the landmark $400 billion gas pipeline deal as well as military cooperation encompassing joint counter-terrorism exercises conducted bi- and multilaterally, the partnership has achieved the breakthrough that it always desired. But this has not always been the case with China and Russia. The rhetoric has changed drastically over the course of history. From the phase of intense political and economic cooperation in the 1950's alternated with years of hostility and obdurate suspicion post the 1969 border war, to the normalization of ties in 1989 and the stable strategic partnership at present: this relation has come a long way.

Most evaluations of this relationship have classified it into an 'axis of convenience', not clearly encapsulating the true meaning of this relationship. So what really binds the two countries is the real question. It is not only their bilateral interests to cooperate in the economic, military and political arenas, but also the deep rooted convergences towards the regional and global issues.

Both China and Russia have emphasized on the common principles of less military action and noninterference in global hotspots including Korean Peninsula and Middle East. Their regional security collaboration backdrop is characterized by equality, ingenuousness and transparency and is a key factor in the harmony and stability of Asia Pacific region. On the Korean Peninsula both countries stress upon the importance of political and diplomatic solution under the framework of Six Party talks. They have welcomed the full membership of Pakistan and India into the SCO aiming towards regional peace building and are also working together to reinstate the confidence of the global community regarding the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. According to them, the internal processes of the countries of the region must not be meddled with outside forces. The formation and development of a strategic cooperative conglomerate is based on by their collective strategic interest.

However, this relationship is not devoid of points of friction in the Central Asian region where both countries continue to exert their dominance. The impact of Eurasian Economic Union established by Russia and its tariffs on the level of trade and investments in the region as China remains the chief economic partners of Central Asian states and their main source of development finance remains to be seen. China, however has accepted that Russia needs to be treated as a partner on equal terms and has garnered support from Russia on its initiatives including the Silk Road Economic belt and Asian Infrastructure Bank. As the two leaders signed a joint declaration 'On cooperation in coordinating development of EEU and Silk Road Economic belt'; the common goal emerges as to coordinate the two projects in order to build a common financial space in Eurasia including a Free Trade Agreement between the EEU and China. This document is significant evidence that a genuine and sustainable partnership between Moscow and Beijing is foreseeable. And, if hypothetically, Moscow transforms the adversity of the present crisis caused by three pronged damage due to collapse of oil price, western sanctions and economic slowdown into opportunity through structural reforms by launching a strategy of economic development it can emerge much stronger than before.

For both countries, this relation should also be viewed with respect to their approach towards the United States. While resistance to the formation of the infamous 'unipolar world' became part of their official rhetoric, their respective nature of the relationship with United States operates on different levels. Pre-dominantly China's relationship with the West is economic and fortunately for this reason, it's rapprochement with the West will not inevitably be detrimental for Russia. In essence, the Kremlin must begin to comprehend that any pivot to Asia is unmanageable without first cultivating its frayed relationship with the West.

Enhanced competition between US, Russia and China is inevitable in the long term: a delicate balance of power is the true crux of diplomacy. In the context of world affairs, it may take three to work towards a peaceful understanding.

Top government ministers on Monday urged the visiting 100-member Chinese delegation to take advantage of Pakistan's liberal foreign investment regime.

Speaking at the first high-level conference on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Commerce Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan said 100 per cent foreign equity is permitted in the manufacturing and infrastructure projects under Pakistan's liberal foreign investment regime.

The minister expressed the hope that the delegation during their stay in Pakistan would interact with Pakistani businessmen in Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi which would open new avenues of cooperation between the two countries in trade and investment.

China is Pakistan's major trading partner and volume of trade reached an all-time high of $12.299 billion in 2014-15. Pakistan's exports rose to $2.1bn in 2014-15, an increase of more than three-and-a-half times.

Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal said that CPEC was a flagship role-model project. We have chalked out an impressive programme through which participants can explore various opportunities lying in provinces, the minister remarked.

The delegation will travel to Lahore where business-to-business sessions with prominent CEOs and senior executives of top companies in Punjab will be organised by the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) on Jan 20. The government of Punjab will arrange field visits of the delegation to major industrial areas on Jan 21.

On Jan 22, the delegation will meet premier Karachi-based businesses at an event organised by the Pakistan Business Council, with the support of Sindh government and TDAP.

Ahsan Iqbal said that CPEC would connect the nodes of growth centers. Significant nodes along the corridor would be Kashgar, Taxkorgan, Khunjerab, Peshawar, Islamabad, Lahore, Multan, Sukkur, Quetta, Karachi and Gwadar and such other growth centers which may fall within the CPEC in future.

It will also be connected with trade facilitation corridors, dedicated freight corridors, energy corridors, trade logistics corridor and telecommunications corridor, he added.

He said that the proposed initial $46bn investment was only the beginning. We are hoping that it will soon become $500bn with industrial and commercial cooperation, the minister remarked.

Pakistan-China Friendship Association President Sha Zukang said China initiated the construction of Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Maritime Silk Road.

This initiative shows China's vision to promote peaceful development of the world through strengthening policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people bond among continents of Asia, Europe and Africa.

He said that Pakistan is the converging point of the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21th Century Maritime Silk Road. The construction of the CPEC would not only promote development of cities along the corridor, but it would benefit people of both the countries, and enhance stability and prosperity of the region, he added.

The Chinese delegates will explore trade and investment opportunities in energy, infrastructure, textiles, agriculture, renewable energy, privatisation, engineering, information and communications technologies and mining sectors.

The commerce ministry with the support of Board of Investment (BoI), Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) and World Bank organised the conference.

Moreover, there will be option in the application which will enable users to get information of their choice about China and post their opinions.

Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid, while speaking to participants, said the new application would help provide information about China to even those Pakistanis who did not have access to traditional electronic and print media.

The application has allowed 25 million Pakistani mobile users the opportunity to get information about China at their finger tips, the minister said.

The novel application speaks volumes about the depth of Pakistan-China relations and the abiding interests that the people of China have in the people of Pakistan, he added.

The year 2015 was declared as the year of cultural exchanges between the two countries.

Pakistan, China cultural corridor is directly linked to China, Pakistan Economic Corridor as it focuses on the centuries-old famous silk route, the minister said.

Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong said the application would further improve relations between the two countries.

People will be able to get information about China and it will improve cultural relations as well, he said.

RECENTLY, US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter reportedly opened a meeting with senior Pakistani military leaders by declaring: I must tell you, I am a friend of India.

The statement, besides being gauche, was superfluous. Carter's closeness to the Indians is all too evident. The US defence secretary has met four times in the last year with his Indian counterpart, as noted in the joint communique issued after his recent visit to India.

Explore: 'We try to be a trusted partner of India', says US Defence Secy

The joint communique outlines the vast scope and depth of the present and planned Indo-US military relationship; including co-production of advanced defence articles, joint research on advanced jet engines and aircraft carrier technologies, and strategic cooperation on maritime security.

Most significantly, India endorsed the US stand on the South China Sea islands dispute with China by reaffirming importance of freedom of navigation and over-flight throughout the region, including in the South China Sea and vowed support for a regional security architecture.

Read more: India, US 'agree in principle' to share military logistics

The US alliance with India has obvious and significant negative implications for Pakistan's security.

The US has opened all military and technology doors to India, and encouraged Israel and other allies to do so as well. For the past eight years, India has been the world's largest arms importer, buying over $100 billion in weapons each year, two-thirds of which are deployed against Pakistan. Moreover, US military and political support encourages India in its bellicose behaviour towards Pakistan.

It is not merely that Pakistan suffers 'collateral damage' from the US arming of India against China. The US has imposed - formally and informally - severe and discriminatory restraints on Pakistan's acquisition of advanced and dual-use technologies and weapons systems from the US or allied sources.

It opposes Pakistan's defensive responses to India's build-up: fissile material production, theatre nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. Pressure has even been exerted on China not to transfer advanced weaponry and technologies to Pakistan. Unless this dynamic is changed, Pakistan's capabilities for conventional defence and nuclear deterrence against India could be significantly eroded.

The latest confirmation of the Indo-US alliance comes at a time when Pakistan's limited convergence with the US on Afghanistan may be fading. According to Indian press reports, Ashton Carter conveyed to the Indians that the US has given up on Pakistan's cooperation to stabilise Afghanistan, and wants India to play a larger role there.

The US alliance with India has negative implications for Pakistan's security.

Worse, the US appears to be encouraging closer ties between India and the GCC states, especially Saudi Arabia, which Modi's visited recently. There may be an Iranian gambit as well. Given India's close relations with Iran and informal US-Iranian cooperation against the militant Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, collaboration between the US, India and Iran to 'stabilise' Afghanistan cannot be ruled out.

Pakistan must formulate a well-considered and calibrated military and diplomatic response to these adverse developments. Capitulation is not an option. India's treatment of Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh should be a lesson against acceptance of Indian hegemony.

Pakistan's military response will have to be defensive, asymmetrical, and designed to preserve the ability to deter and repel a conventional Indian attack, and the credibility of nuclear deterrence.

To break up a large Indian surprise attack (projected by the Cold Start doctrine), Pakistan can multiply its short-range, conventional missile capabilities. Air defence can also be best assured by anti-aircraft and ballistic missile defence systems. On the sea, Pakistan cannot afford expensive aircraft carriers; its defence will have to rely on submarines, large numbers of fast missile boats, and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.

To maintain credible nuclear deterrence and dissuade a pre-emptive enemy strike, Pakistan needs to continue to multiply its short, medium and long-range missile capabilities. Ultimately, the deployment of nuclear submarine-based missiles offers the most credible second strike option.

And, so long as India persists in its reported support for the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, and the Balochi Liberation Army, Pakistan would be unwise to give up the option of supporting the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people for freedom and self-determination.

Pakistan's diplomacy will have to be dynamic and imaginative.

Strategic cooperation with China will remain critical. Just as the US is willing to share cutting-edge military technologies with India, China should be expected to share its most advanced weapons systems with Pakistan, including nuclear submarines, stealth aircraft, and its anti-aircraft carrier missiles.

Pakistan also needs to do much more to enhance military and diplomatic cooperation with Russia, which is locked in a new Cold War with the US, displeased with India's embrace of America, and much closer to China. Several Russian weapons systems - the S300 anti-ballistic missile and the SU-31 fighter-bomber - are among the best in class.

In Afghanistan, Pakistan should clearly draw its 'red lines': no Indian military presence or use of Afghan territory for subversion against Pakistan. While continuing to support inter-Afghan dialogue, Islamabad should be prepared for a collapse in Kabul and prolonged Afghan chaos. Fostering an understanding with Iran is essential. Pakistan and Iran can cooperatively normalise their respective parts of Baluchistan and stabilise Afghanistan - unless Iran decides to align itself with India.

Rebuilding a close relationship with Saudi Arabia will restrain Indian penetration in the Gulf. This requires full support to the House Of Saud; it does not require participation in hostile operations against Iran.

Pakistan should continue its diplomatic engagement with the US, although there may be rough times ahead in the relationship.

The Sino-US rivalry is likely to get worse in the near future, given the angry and ugly mood in America, and rising nationalist sentiment in China. Eventually, once China acquires comparable military power, and large parts of Eurasia are incorporated into China's 'One Belt, One Road' economic community, Washington may come to accept coexistence and cooperation with the new superpower.

It may also come to recognise that Pakistan is a critical country whose cooperation is vital to ensure regional stability in south and west Asia, to prevent nuclear non-proliferation, and to and defeat global terrorism. Perhaps then, Washington will respect Pakistan's legitimate security concerns.

Pakistan is at a crossroads. As usual. This is not a surprise, for Pakistan is - always has and always been - at a crossroads; perhaps it always will be.

It seems so obvious that the country is at a point of having to decide its future: what should the response be with regards to religious fundamentalism; how should relations with India be improved (and should they even be improved); what is the right path to take with Iran, with Afghanistan, with the rest of the world; how can parts of the country, that feel like they are slipping into the cracks, be brought back into the fold - should the emphasis be on gentle persuasion and encouragement, or is this a time to take a more robust stand? And what about the Panama Papers - will political leaders never learn from the past?

The good news - and the bad news - is that the questions and the answers are identical. The problem is not that Pakistan is at a crossroads; the problem is that Pakistan is the crossroads.

It is the crossroads between East and West, and between North and South. Trade and transportation routes that weave Asia together intersect in Pakistan - which explains why the country has so many rich variations, so many different traditions, and despite the recent suicide bombing in Lahore, a long and proud tradition of tolerance.

The area that comprises modern Pakistan saw some of the greatest cultural and intellectual achievements in world history, from the glory of Mohenjodaro and Harappa millennia ago, to the remarkable flourishing that saw Sindh celebrated as one of the greatest prizes of the Muslim world - when ports like Debul fell to Arab armies at the start of the eighth century. The centrality of the country continued long after that, with thriving centres like Thatta being viewed with wonder by Europeans, who visited in growing numbers in the centuries that followed.

Empires have risen, and fallen, in line with the fortunes of the region that today makes up modern Pakistan.

Nor was it the coast of Pakistan that was bursting with life, energy and culture, for cities like Lahore were celebrated a thousand years ago in ways that are immediately recognisable to visitors of the city today: Lahore, wrote the author of the Hudud al-Alam, was a glorious place, marked by spectacularly beautiful places of worship, well-stocked markets, and carefully laid-out orchards (the anonymous author was less impressed with the city's inhabitants, who he thought were crude and blessed with poor manners).

It is not surprising therefore that empires have risen, and fallen, in line with the fortunes of the region that today makes up modern Pakistan. This does not only include great leaders like Akbar and Jahangir, who recognised that control of their own empire was best established by controlling Punjab - or Ranjit Singh, who created an extraordinarily successful and diverse state that was a military, political and cultural force to be reckoned with 200 years ago.

In fact, what happened in and around Pakistan shaped events and empires far away. The Persian empire saw perhaps its greatest ever success with the rampaging invasion of Nader Shah which saw Lahore and then Delhi ravaged, and their proudest and richest jewels (like the Peacock Throne and the celebrated Koh-e-Noor diamond) looted to adorn the palaces and crowns of Persian leaders.

And then of course came the time of the British, who arrived first as traders, but soon found themselves intermediaries, and as military muscle who could be persuaded to become involved in domestic affairs by ambitious (or desperate) rulers. This generated trading concessions that eventually allowed British merchants to have the upper hand against those from other countries - but also over domestic traders.

The process of acceleration - from partners to having privileged positions to administrators and rulers - was one echoed in many parts of the world that Europe came into contact with: empire was not part of a European master plan. It just so happened that opportunities kept opening up which were too good to miss out on. In 1757, for example, Robert Clive of the East India Company found himself placed in charge of the entire economy of Bengal. At a stroke, Bengalis lost control of their own fate and, literally, of their own fortunes.

For Pakistan today, therefore, it is time for decision-making again. For all the big questions to face up to in the country's tangled and complicated domestic and international affairs, the one which will have by far the most significant consequences in the future is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Massive investment from China into much-needed infrastructure, such as roads, a huge deep-water port at Gwadar, and perhaps in due course even a high-speed railway, seems like a gift at a time when there is limited foreign direct investment into the country. Commitments likewise to upgrade the energy grid across Pakistan promise to transform the country by finally providing reliable power sources; the absence of which have prevented industry and business, as well as schools and homes, from being able to truly flourish.

The danger, of course, is that (as happened when the British and Europeans arrived in Asia) outside help is used to solve today's problems at the cost of storing up new, more complex problems for tomorrow. The dangers and risks are particularly acute, moreover, in democratic states, where long-term planning is particularly difficult; politicians are strongly incentivised to think about upcoming elections, rather than what might (or might not) happen in a generation's time.

Massive Chinese investment can - and will - help transform Pakistan if it is handled correctly, and if fair and equitable terms are agreed upon. It also matters to revisit these terms, as the world keeps changing, not least in the case of China. When President Xi Jinping announced the 'One Belt, One Road' initiative in 2013, things looked rather differently compared to 2015, as China's slowdown and 'new normal' mean that decisions and plans are being adjusted in Beijing.

It should be comforting to know that China, like Pakistan, is at a crossroads too. Working together, with mutual interests being promoted and protected, is not only nothing to be afraid of, it is entirely sensible and logical. It all depends on getting the details right - and on learning the lessons of history.

Former foreign secretary Riaz H Khokhar on Tuesday said Pakistan's foreign policy would not produce any results unless we set our own house in order.

Speaking at a seminar on: 'Pakistan's Neighbourhood: Afghanistan, India, the Middle East' organised by Institute for Policy Reforms (IPR) at Comstech Secretariat, he called upon Pakistan and India to sort out their issues as advised by US President Barack Obama while addressing the Nuclear Summit recently.

He said when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tried to improve relations with India, though he faced criticism.

Former secretary says foreign policy will not produce any results 'unless we set our own house in order'

While talking about CPEC he said that Chinese had not only shown concerns over security but over the capacity and the capability of Pakistan to complete the project.

The security issue seems to have been addressed after Pakistan Army took over the CEPC security. But objections over the project is a serious source of concern for China and they have suggested to the government to take all the provinces on board over the project, he said.

He lauded the government's decision not to get involved in Yemen's conflict, though Saudi Arabia wanted Pakistan Army there.

International affairs specialist Mr Anatol Lieven, who recently visited Afghanistan, said that Pakistan must continue supporting the peace process in Afghanistan.

With respect to relations with India, he said it was very wise decision by Pakistan and India not to escalate tension.

For now, it is essential that conflict should not escalate, he added.

There is a need for a quiet dialogue between the intelligence agencies of the two countries, he added.

He said in the Middle East, Pakistan must not get entangled in the rivalries between the countries. It was essential that Pakistan balanced its relations with Iran and the Gulf.

Full integration into China's One Belt One Road (OBOR) holds great promise for the future of Pakistan's economy. OBOR will make Pakistan a hub of regional connectivity. In order to do so, Pakistan must maintain internal stability and not allow further violence in the country, he said.

Former Ambassador Ashraf Jehangir Qazi stated that Pakistan's relations with its three neighbours - Afghanistan, Iran and India - were at a standstill.

If Pakistan becomes unstable, the countries which are considering themselves stable will also become unstable, he said.

IPR chairperson Humayun Akhtar Khan said the purpose of the discussion was to take stock of recent developments in Pakistan's neighbourhood.

He said security in Afghanistan continued to be a concern. Last year alone, the country lost about 6,000 security personnel to violence. At the same time, the Taliban has gained more territory, he said, adding recently, renewed battles have taken place in Afghanistan following the Taliban's announced spring offensive.

Regarding India, he referred to its continued programme of enhancing defence capability coupled with an active foreign policy. He expressed the hope that Pakistan would adopt more calibrated approach towards India.

While replying to a question that why Pakistan does not enjoy good relations with three, out of four, neighbours and weather this was it a failure of the Foreign Office, Mr Khokhar said that the Foreign Office can only advise and suggest the options.

Decisions are made by the leadership. Once a policy is made Foreign Office has to implement it, he said.


 

 

Asia-Pacific to account for 40pc of energy investments by 2040

The Asia-Pacific region is expected to account for over 40 per cent of the $68 trillion of cumulative energy investments until 2040, according to a document prepared by the United Nations regional commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP).

The document prepared for the policy dialogue on energy for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific opening in Bangkok on Monday, says with energy demand in Asia and the Pacific forecast to nearly double from 2010 to 2035, access to reliable and adequate energy services will remain a focus for the decades to come.

Of the $68 trillion, $22 trillion will be needed for investments in energy efficiency. It is expected that two thirds of projected investments will be in non-OECD countries and in Asia, and about half of this will be required in the power sector (i.e. generation, transmission and distribution) to fill much needed demand and access gaps.

The region's energy imports have grown rapidly from 525 mega tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 1980 to 2.3 billion Mtoe in 2013. Compared to 1980, the region's energy import share of the global total has nearly doubled from 23 per cent to nearly 44 per cent in 2013. Compared to imports, overall exports have remained more or less stagnant at around one third of global energy exports since 1990.

The region is expected to remain dependent on oil in the medium term, as the mobility and transport of goods and people is critical for economic development. Currently, transport is currently heavily dependent upon oil and is the fastest growing source of global carbon emissions. With growing middle class in the region and rapid urbanization, overall oil demand for personal mobility and transportation of goods is expected to rise significantly.

Three future trends are likely to dominate the Sustainable Development Agenda for the Asia-Pacific region. First, the next few decades will see a tremendous rise in the urban population globally, but particularly in the region; and new cities and new buildings will have to be built to cope with rapid urbanization. Second, the world will witness a major rise in global middle class: from 1.8 billion in 2009 to 4.9 billion by 2030.

Asia will represent 66 per cent of the global middle class population and 59 per cent of global middle-class consumption, compared to 28 per cent and 23 per cent today. The emergence of a large middle class will have a significant impact on energy demand and on the goods and services that have embedded energy.

In order to effectively progress energy connectivity within Asia and the Pacific there is a need for a common understanding of the benefits by member States. This could lead to a shared vision for energy connectivity that could encompass a connected and fully energized Asia-Pacific region.

Regional integration will not solve all energy challenges, but smart region-wide energy connectivity can play a valuable role in improving energy supply and minimising the environmental impact. It is possible for the Asia-Pacific region to expand supplies, reduce overall cost of energy produced and consumed, lower environmental and social costs, and reduce energy insecurities if energy networks are connected, it says.

According to the 'Regional Trends Report on Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific', energy access has remained as the major challenge and the energy poverty is acute in the region impeding development process and economic growth.

In the region, there are 455 million populations live without access to electricity and 2.06 billion relying upon solid fuels for cooking and heating. Mostly the rural populations in the region are deprived of energy access due to unaffordability, low per capita consumption, lack of technological capacity and high capital investment required.

New initiatives are emerging in this region major energy exporter the Russian Federation is turning to the Asian market and major energy importer China formulated the Belt and Road initiatives, both look into energy cooperation with other countries.

The new established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the BRICS New Development Bank, the Silk Road Fund and Shanghai Cooperation Organization will play an important role in regional investment and cooperation, including regional energy connectivity.


 

 

The CPEC trick

AFTER a second spate of conflict a few months ago, Pakistan's political leaders announced they had reached a consensus over the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). It was a great relief for architects of the 'One Belt, One Road' (OBOR) project in Beijing. CPEC is not just a flagship project for the Chinese to incentivise other regions for similar projects, it's also a test case for them to intervene in and acclimatise to the politico-economic and administrative structures, and business cultures of partnering nations.

South Asia is probably the toughest region for the Chinese because of its varying democratic and economic environments, which despite looking similar have fundamentally different structures. Inter- and intra-state conflicts and tensions are another challenge facing China, which would prefer to achieve its ambitions without getting involved in any conflict or confrontation. China knows that the successful implementation of OBOR cannot be possible without peace and stability in the region the project would traverse.

Apparently, China is trying to please stakeholder nations through the 'normalisation approach', which requires no strategic or economic cost or compromises, but rather diplomacy, to make ways for broader cooperation. Recent warm exchanges between China and India are one example. Chinese diplomacy is moving forward pragmatically; the Chinese authorities are cognisant of apportioning stature and importance to nations in accordance with the latter's stakes in OBOR initiatives. China is focusing on the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar corridor to link the Yunan province in south-western China with South Asia, which is not only geo-economically significant (extracting the maximum potential of South Asian markets), but is also strategically important (in the context of the US pivot to the Asia-Pacific region).

Much has been said about the geostrategic impact of OBOR, but the real challenge for Chinese diplomacy will be to keep the project sailing amidst intra-state tensions in the regions of its implementation. Particularly, it will be interesting to see how China will deal with an escalation of tensions within the South Asian region in a post-OBOR scenario. This is not just a matter of potential conflict between India and Pakistan; small South Asian nations are also not comfortable with India's hegemonic approach towards them, particularly Sri Lanka and Nepal. The recent blockade of landlocked Nepal by India put some pressure on Beijing, and the demand of a China-Nepal-India corridor has echoed again.

The real challenge for China will be to keep the project sailing amidst inter- and intra-state tensions.

The stability and security of South Asia is a Chinese priority, but not at the cost of its geo-economic interests in the region. As far as OBOR is concerned, it is an evolving concept which China will review and amend given changing geostrategic requirements. The 'scientific approach' is a new phrase that Chinese policy and business circles often use when discussing the project's timeline and how different projects linked with OBOR would become functional.

The timeline is important; China is facing an 'over-capacity' challenge, and its investors are eagerly looking for immediate avenues, where they can best utilise their labour power, skills and other logistical potential. If found that the initiative is not feasible within their time frame, the preference would be to amend or alter it entirely. This is perhaps why China has avoided entering into any formal treaties with stakeholder nations ie to avoid obligations.

The Chinese position on South Asia's internal tensions and conflicts is clear: China believes that security is primarily the South Asian nations' responsibility. It is more concerned about the security of the corridors and linked economic zones. China has no intention to mediate or intervene in tensions among South Asian countries, nor would it like direct involvement in the security measures for these corridors. The strategic community in Beijing believes that OBOR has put a huge responsibility on China's shoulders, and feel that they must use their 'moral support' more circumspectly when arbitrating on tensions among OBOR stakeholders.

The strategy will be to put in the minimum effort required for stability of the region - as has been their limited, reconciliatory role in the Afghan peace process - while at the same time ensuring that tensions do not escalate to the extent that they threaten Chinese interests.

Experts believe that China's involvement in Afghanistan's peace process resulted not just due to its Istanbul Process commitments, but that internal security issues in Xinjiang province also compelled China to seek cooperation from Afghanistan against the East Turkestan Islamic Movement militants (who are based in Afghanistan). CPEC also requires a stable Afghanistan in order to be realised - particularly in northern parts of the country, where insurgency has been strengthening in recent years.

While this is a challenge, experts believe that China can do the trick. It is interesting that China wants Saarc to become a functional regional-cooperation forum, and an effective trade and business body (like Asean), so that it can maximise the benefits of OBOR. Nonetheless, China will avoid urging South Asian nations too forcefully.

The real enemy of South Asia is poverty, which influences peace and stability, and hurts connectivity among nations. However, strategic communities would prefer to prioritise strategic objectives because of the nature of challenges and ambitions. While Pakistan's strategic challenges are real, the question is whether its economy can bear the burden of these challenges. In such cases, pressure falls on political governments and the state of a poor economy mired in corruption, rather than putting things in their real contexts, and addressing structural issues.

China is not concerned with the socio-political and economic structural issues of Pakistan. It is concerned with CPEC as its flagship project - and the Chinese want to see it realised as a successful initiative within a limited time frame. Still, their concerns are intrinsically linked with Pakistan's internal security and political stability. Both factors are crucial for the timely completion of this project, however, it is apparent that should things go wrong, China will prefer not to interfere in Pakistan's internal affairs. Frustrations sometimes reach levels where the Chinese compromise on their diplomatic objectives. Often, this trick works.


 

 

Federal minister refuses to speak on CPEC in presence of nationalist leader

The lengthy speech by Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal on China-Pak Economic Corridor -- Myth and Reality at Islamia College University here on Thursday had an unpleasant start when he refused to speak in the presence of Pakhtunkhwa Ulasi Tehreek leader Dr Said Alam Mehsud.

It is pertinent to mention here that Dr Said Alam Mehsud had earlier briefed the provincial government and leaders of political parties on CPEC and rights of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa connected with this project being termed by the PML-N minister as the 'game-changer in the region'.

Dr Mehsud and his team, holding files, had come prepared to raise some questions at the seminar where they had been invited by the ICU, which had organised the discussion.

However, Dr Mehsud got up and told the large gathering mostly students of the university that they had been asked to leave since the federal minister had refused to speak in their presence. We are leaving because Ahsan Iqbal has refused to speak if we are here. They myth is gone. This is the reality, he said ironically.

Ahsan Iqbal's speech at seminar focuses on 'Vision-2025' instead of economic corridor

Some of the students even raised slogans against this discourteous behaviour but Dr Mehsud and his team left the venue peacefully.

Soon Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal came to the stage and started his speech with 'Vision-2025' which focused more on having a future where economy of the country would be among that of the top 10 countries in the next 10 years.

He also assured the Islamia College University of providing the grant of Rs1 billion that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had earlier announced for the ICU during his visit.

He also clarified how those few people, who raised hue and cry about neglecting Pakhtuns in the CPEC, were wrong since Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were frontline provinces and geographically it was not possible to bypass those provinces in interlinking Gwadar with Central Asia and China.

The minister said that he had a four-hour long sitting earlier at Governor's House in Peshawar to explain the CPEC and remove misconceptions that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was ignored in the project but some people did not get it while many understood his point of view.

Although he told the participants that he would be ready to answer and satisfy those, who had critical questions, and wanted to clear their minds on CPEC, the minister made such a long speech, having more focus on how Pakistan was envisioned under 'Vision-2025', that by the time he started talking on CPEC many of the participants were yawning and looked exhausted.

With Dr Mehsud and his team having all the documentary details of the CPEC gone, the students looked lost at the details the minister was giving about Pakistan's geographical position and advantages that needed to be taken from its location than just raising slogans of Pak-China friendship.

Mr Iqbal said that Pakistan needed to become a robust economy than taking pride in just being an atomic power since times had changed. Now quality, productivity and innovation are new currencies, he added.

Finally coming to the topic of the seminar, CPEC-Myth and Reality, he said that it was a fusion of China and Pakistan and meant 'one belt, one road'. It consisted of reviving the old Silk Route and establishing a maritime silk road. It is unique because it would be bridging the land and sea routes, he added.

The minister said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan were very important for regional connectivity. To integrate Central Asia or for the Gwadar to be outlet for Central Asia, tell me how come we can neglect Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa? It is not possible geographically to bypass these provinces, he added.

He said that CPEC was a long-term framework so in next 15 years Pakistan needed to produce energy to run Economic zones and industries.

He said that out of 46 bn dollars that were expected to be invested, some 35 bn dollars were supposed to be invested in energy sector. Ignoring the fact that KP had a potential for hydle and natural gas power generation, the federal minister said that since 70 per cent of the energy was produced in country from hydle , they have decided to induct coal for energy production which was why such projects would be started in Sindh and Balochistan.

Media adds: Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal on Thursday rejected the Terms of Reference (ToRs) of opposition parties about Panama leaks issue, saying the ToRs were not against corruption.

Talking to media here at Islamia College University, he said it had become crystal clear from the ToRs of the opposition that those parties were not concerned about corruption.

He said that opposition wanted to get political mileage out of the so-called ToRs. Since the name of prime minister was not mentioned in the list of Panama leaks then how he could be linked with the issue, he questioned.

The minister said the prime minister was focusing on across the board development in the country and announcement of international airport in Bannu and university in Lakki Marwat was reflection of his commitment.

He said that common man was not concerned with the Panama Papers rather people wanted solution to their basic problems. The federal government has increased the higher education budget from Rs48 billion to Rs78 billion, he said and added that new universities would be set up in Fata, Zhob and Gwadar.

PAKISTAN is on the road to achieving an economic transformation through its partnership with the People's Republic of China, which has pledged $46 billion towards various projects aimed at catalysing infrastructural development in Pakistan.

China has done this to find an outlet for getting its products to the Middle East and onward to the rest of the world through a land route culminating at the Gwadar Port, which is already being managed by a Chinese company. The government of Pakistan has agreed to raise an army division to protect the economic corridor and the Chinese nationals engaged in these projects.

China already has access to alternate land routes through the Eurasian Land Bridge, also called the New Silk Road, and the Trans-Siberian Railway called the Northern East-West Corridor. Iran, too, is linked through railway to this communication network. However, the proposed route provides an economical road link, which allows time to be saved in the transportation of goods by providing a direct shorter road thereby ensuring significant economic advantage.

This connection is also important for China as it has embarked on an ambitious programme of development in its western region that has so far been outside the ambit of impressive developments and economic progress seen in other parts of the country. A direct short connection for transporting the products of this region to the world market will guarantee the viability of industrialisation in the region that will not only bring prosperity to the area but will also address the critical nagging security issues spilling over into Sinkiang province from neighbouring countries including Pakistan.

For GB, it is absolutely vital that the benefits of CPEC are experienced uniformly.

Trade will also be a stabilising factor for the entire region. The route link in the northern part of Pakistan runs through Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), which is a disputed region with an ambivalent constitutional status. Even an earlier border settlement with China had to be done through a provisional international treaty.

The people of GB fear that the fruit of this massive development economic corridor will be nothing beyond ribbon development on the existing Karakoram Highway (KKH), which will be the arterial transportation road. The only economic zone proposed for the entire area of GB on the route is again on the KKH. Such myopic planning effectively excludes the areas located away from the KKH.

This economic corridor was envisioned as having a vast nationwide spread that would benefit all the people of Pakistan through inclusive planning. Unfortunately, the entire development programme has become focused on the eastern route with massive investments in hurriedly planned power and road projects, effectively depriving the other regions at the expense of the western route despite the protest of the two smaller provinces and the GB region.

For GB, it is absolutely vital that benefits are experienced uniformly. It is alarming that the on-ground position effectively excludes the entire Baltistan division, district of Astore and many areas of Gilgit division situated away from the KKH.

This rather unjust treatment by the federation of this strategically positioned area at the head of the corridor can give rise to misgivings that will generate serious protests compromising the viability of this project. It would be in the interest of this project to examine the possibilities of building road linkages for the entire region and to spread out the projects in every area to allay the concerns of the population. This should also be the blueprint for uniform development of all the provinces.

A close study of the map of this region presents numerous alternative routes that will reduce the distance and will also address the endemic security issues on a major part of the KKH that passes through a turbulent area plagued by perpetual security challenges. A survey by a group of informed residents of the area has produced an alternate route that will not only reduce the distance between Gilgit to Islamabad by 55 kilometres but also provide a passage through a peaceful region.

The proposed route takes off from KKH at Thalichi and through Astore district goes to Rattu. From there, the route progresses over the Shuhter Pass and connects to the road linking Muzaffarabad and winds down to Islamabad. There is another bypass from Jaglot to Skardu and from a point short of Skardu a non-metalled road exists up to the meeting point at Rattu.

These linkages have the advantage of providing a safe way and alternate route in case of blockage of KKH due to landslides, as with a change in weather, the area through which the KKH traverses has in the recent past experienced prolonged disruption of the traffic due to frequent landslides. This ensures uninterrupted flow of the traffic from China to Gwadar with the advantage of more secure passage in case of any disturbance en route.

It would be in the interest of the people of GB and the country to consider these possibilities seriously and integrate these proposals in CPEC projects on a priority basis. The success of CPEC depends on the goodwill of the people of the regions through which this corridor passes and also certainty of the traffic flow without any disruption. These alternate routes can address both issues.

These will also make CPEC all inclusive by integrating the excluded areas of Gilgit-Baltistan in the development process and provide an alternate safe and shorter passage. They will have the added advantage of providing access to Azad Jammu and Kashmir in the economic opportunities presented by the economic corridor.

The policymakers must understand that investment in hurriedly planned coal, oil and gas power projects in Sindh and Punjab will not guarantee the success of CPEC; it will depend on a secure passage through a peaceful route with a satisfied population living around it. If the corridor generates controversies, feelings of deprivation and neglect, we will only be stoking the fire of existing turmoil in the country that will surely cause the collapse of this spectacular opportunity to make Pakistan prosperous in all its regions.


 

 

Hurdles in Gwadar Port development removed: minister

Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal said on Monday that all hurdles in way of development of Gwadar Port had been removed with the cooperation of the Chinese government.

Briefing a parliamentary committee on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the minister said all pending issues pertaining to the Gwadar Port had been resolved during his visit to Beijing last month. These include construction of an international airport and an expressway in the town.

It was an in camera briefing held at the Pakistan Institute of Parliamentary Services and no media person was allowed to attend it.

According to an official handout, Mr Iqbal said Gwadar would be given top priority because it was an entry point for the CPEC where the Maritime Silk Road and Silk Road Economic Belt converged. He informed the committee that other projects in Gwadar, including a hospital, a desalination plant and a technical training institute would be built on a fast track basis and rights and livelihood of local fishermen would be protected.

He welcomed the committee's upcoming visit to China from May 20 to 27 and said this would help its members understand the CPEC project and learn about the Chinese pattern of economic development.

He claimed that during a meeting of the committee with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, the speaker and parliamentary leaders of parties of the provincial assembly held at the Planning Commission on May 10, issues pertaining to the CPEC had been amicably resolved and the KP government as well as political leadership of the province had expressed satisfaction over the progress of CPEC as their reservations had been addressed by the federal government.

The parliamentary committee praised Mr Iqbal for achieving the consensus through consultation as well as MNA Asad Umar, a member of the committee, for facilitating the dialogue between the KP government and the centre.

The committee's chairman Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed said China had given a vote of confidence in the future of Pakistan and its people by investing extensively in different sectors to promote socio-economic development of Pakistan.

He said the CPEC would be vital for uniting the federation and the provinces and bring prosperity and development to the provinces.

The committee was also briefed on relations between Pakistan and China.

According to Mr Syed, the committee members will visit three cities Beijing, Shanghai and Suzhou - and an industrial park between China and Singapore. The visit coincides with the 65th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China.

In order to address the opposition's reservations, the committee suggested regular meetings of the CPEC steering committee headed by the prime minister and comprising the chief ministers.

Opposition parties demanded that a six-lane corridor should be built on the CPEC's western route instead of the planned four-lane road and that industrial zones and other infrastructure promised by the government along the route be ensured.

Talking to Dawn, Mushaid Hussain said it had been decided that a big runway would be constructed at Gwadar Port to facilitate big planes. The issue of statutory regulatory orders (SROs) regarding taxes to be levied at the port had been resolved and all taxes defined and framed through a hectic exercise, he added.

He said an old master plan of Gwadar, which was dumped a decade ago, would be revised and it had been decided that the revised master plan would be implemented in letter and spirit.

Under the plan, the people of Gwadar will be considered as main stakeholder and fishermen of the area will also be accommodated, he said.

Federal Ombudsman Salman Faruqui presented to President Mamnoon Hussain three separate reports suggesting some reforms in pensions, prisons and police station systems of the country at a meeting at the Presidency on Tuesday.

Federal Tax Ombudsman Abdur Rauf Chaudhry also attended the meeting.

A spokesman for the president said that President Mamnoon Hussain welcomed the preparation of a comprehensive report by experts for resolution of pension issues of retired government employees. The president expressed the hope that these reports would help improve working of these offices.

The president asked the Federal Ombudsman to continue his work to provide free and speedy justice to the people.

Mr Mamnoon appreciated the work of the Federal Ombudsman and requested him that while disposing different cases, he should also suggest some disciplinary action against officials involved in maladministration besides providing relief to the complainant.

The spokesman quoted the president as saying: Laws are meant to help and facilitate people and not to create difficulties for them. Seven committees of the Federal Ombudsman set up to examine the working of various government organisations will submit effective and practicable recommendations to the government for providing better services to the people.

BEIJING FORUM: At a separate ceremony for inauguration of the Beijing Forum at the NUST University, the president said that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was a historic step forward for the welfare of people and the development of road, rail, sea and air infrastructure projects by the two countries would transform the region into a hub for regional and global trade.

Adviser to Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz, Minister for Defence Production and Science and Technology Rana Tanveer Hussain, Chairman of Peking University Council Prof Zhu Shan Lu, China's Ambassador to Pakistan Sun Weidong and Rector of NUST retired Lt-Gen Muhammad Asghar were also present on the occasion.

The president expressed satisfaction that Islamabad had been chosen for holding the Beijing Forum's first session outside China.

It is a matter of satisfaction that National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) and Peking University have taken the initiative for organising this event for which both these eminent institutions and their organisers deserve to be praised.

He said the CPEC would not only lead to a robust regional connectivity but it would also be a foundation for historical One Belt - One Road vision of China which would usher in an era of global peace, prosperity and stability.

Pak-China relations are a model for the entire world and both countries have always adopted a common stance at all forums for resolution of international issues, regional peace and stability and have wholeheartedly extended cooperation to the international community for achievement of these objectives, he added.

The president said that the youth of the two countries would play a leading role in this endeavour as highlighted by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah that youth were the real architects of future.


 

 

Projects in Iran, Pakistan can complement each other:  China

China does not see the recent move by Iran in collaboration with Afghanistan, and with financial support from India, to develop the port and road network at Chabahar for expanding regional trade as an attempt to undermine the Gwadar port project or the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In fact, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang is convinced that the projects have the potential to complement each other in boosting the otherwise sluggish economies of the region.

In an interaction with a group of Asian newspaper editors, Premier Li said the economic crises in Asia as well as in the rest of the world could be countered by encouraging and supporting each of the regional countries in taking effective measures.

Rejecting the notion that the Chabahar project could be an irritant to China's ambitious 'one belt, one road' project that plans to connect over two dozen countries for the purpose of trade, he said Beijing might even like to benefit from it. And I think other countries should also consider doing the same, he said, because economic progress in the region could only come through mutual understanding of our shared goals and objectives.

Li Keqiang says China will never seek hegemony nor will it bully any country

The Chabahar project has lately been a topic of intense discussion in Pakistan, where some believe it is in response to CPEC, and a few have gone to the extent of declaring it a security threat to Pakistan.

During the meeting, the discussion largely focused on China being perceived by many as the new 'superpower' and a 'regional bully' vis-a-vis its stated policy on the South China Sea controversy, and conflicts with some of the ASEAN and other regional states.

Premier Li not only denied this impression, he was quite categorical in stating that China did not have any such ambitions. There are no grounds for China to become a superpower, and neither does China have the ambition to become one.

While downplaying the widely held view that China wanted soon to take centre stage as an economic powerhouse and a superpower, Mr Li expressed the view that his country had a long way to go to realise the goals of modernisation.

He went on to say that even if China did achieve modernisation in the coming decades, Beijing would not seek hegemony, and nor would it bully any country, however small that country was in terms of population or landmass.

He did admit that differences existed on certain issues between China and some of the regional countries, but said none of them were serious enough to be a cause of concern. Just as a person might accidentally bite his lips, it is only natural that neighbours will have differences, he said. But the key is to address such issues in a calm and diplomatic way.

The common interests among China and its neighbours are way greater than disparities, and we can always optimise the common interests and better manage our differences.



 

PPP vows to continue support for CPEC

Claiming credit for the concept of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Pakistan Peoples Party vice president Sherry Rehman has said that her party remains wholly committed to, and will continue to make all possible efforts for the smooth and effective implementation of the project.

Reviewing political parties' ties with the Communist Party of China during a bilateral meeting between the two parties on their digital platform here on Saturday, the PPP leader said it was through multiple visits by the then president, Asif Ali Zardari, to Beijing that the groundwork was set for the CPEC, a flagship project of President Xi's bold 'One Belt, One Road' initiative for regional connectivity across the Eurasian landmass.

As a project that could connect multiple regions, she said, the CPEC would not only strengthen Pak-China ties, but also spur better relations between the countries in an evidently tense regional environment.

The PPP is firm in its belief that the CPEC can act as a force multiplier for Pakistan and we will continue to work towards its optimal realisation to this end, according to a press release.

Ms Rehman was emphatic in reminding all that it was under President Zardari's leadership during the last PPP government that the stage was set to scale up the bilateral relationship between China and Pakistan and crucial milestones accomplished to advance durable economic and strategic cooperation between the two countries.

She said the PPP had also played a leading role in forging a political consensus on the significance of Pakistan's relationship with China, including the historic awarding of Gwadar Port entry to Beijing to facilitate the broad vision of economic interdependence. As a result, she said, there was a national consensus in Pakistan regarding the primacy of our ties, reflected by how this relationship continues to be viewed as an all-weather friendship in both countries.

On a discussion on the South China Sea, she said: In an age of growing global changes, the PPP also supported China's principled position on the South China Sea. We believe that disputes related to the South China Sea should be settled through a consultative process between stakeholders and negotiations based on bilateral agreements and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. We respect the efforts made by China and other Asean countries to promote peace and stability in the South China Sea, and will continue to support such efforts.

Ms Rehman said the PPP had always been, and remained committed to, cementing Pakistan's relationship with the CPC and China.

Our friendship with the People's Republic and the Communist Party of China has only gained strength over successive generations of both the parties.

It is true that Pakistan's strategic relationship with China was conceived by former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, cultured by Benazir Bhutto, cemented by Asif Ali Zardari and would now enter a new phase of further cooperation with the younger cohort of leaders in both countries under Chairman Bilawal Bhutto, she said.


 

 

Punjab's focus on development

PUNJAB'S budget for the next fiscal year proposes the current and development outlay of close to Rs1.35-1.36tr and a hefty increase in public investment in large infrastructure projects, social service delivery, agriculture, and pro-poor initiatives and subsidies.

The size of the new budget is estimated to be roughly 18-19pc bigger than the original current and development expenditure target of Rs1.14tr for the outgoing year, and plans to significantly boost tax revenues - especially provincial GST (general sales tax) on services -- by broadening the base and improving voluntary compliance.

The budget for 2016/2017 will focus on development, and target to attain the goals the government has set for itself in the three-year Punjab Growth Strategy 2015-2018, provincial finance minister Ayesha Ghaus-Pasha told Dawn early last week.

The growth strategy envisages to stimulate economic growth to 7-8pc, create 1m jobs every year, help double private investment, significantly alleviate poverty and improve security conditions in the province by 2018, the year of next elections in the country.

It is premature to talk about the estimates and allocations for the next year, the minister said of the volume of the current expenditure and development spending. What I can say at this stage is that you'll see a very hefty increase in the allocation for development, she added.

The budget is expected to be announced on June 10.

Punjab finance department officials told Dawn that the government's current expenditure is estimated to surge by just less than 13pc from Rs753bn for the present year to around Rs850bn next year. The major boost in the provincial expenditure will come mainly from the spike in development expenditure, a senior official involved in budget preparation said.

The investment spending has been proposed to be raised by over a quarter from the ongoing year's original estimate of Rs400bn to Rs500bn for the next fiscal year

The investment spending has been proposed to be raised by over a quarter from the ongoing year's original estimate of Rs400bn to upwards of Rs500bn next year. The spike in the suggested development spending is on account of the Chinese loan of Rs85bn for the Orange train project in Lahore, the official said.

Though not a part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), China's President Xi Jinping had announced to build the train during his landmark visit to Islamabad last year to announce his country's plans to invest $46bn in energy, transport and other large infrastructure projects in Pakistan as part of its ambitious One Belt One Road (OBOR) programme to connect its landlocked western region with the Gulf and Europe via Gwadar.

Minister Ayesha contended that the development strategy will focus on poorer segment of the population to cut poverty by boosting allocations for social sector - education, healthcare, etc - with the objective of improving service delivery as well as providing food, transport and other subsidies, interest-free loans, and scholarships to the poor.

Additionally, we intend to invest Rs100bn in agriculture in the next two years (to reduce rural poverty) besides consolidating and completing the large (road and energy infrastructure) projects already initiated in the province, she added.

The Punjab government is considering boosting its tax revenue target next year in order to increase the share of provincial taxes in its total general revenue receipts. It had marginally reduced its tax target from original estimates of Rs164.68bn for last year to Rs160.59bn - or around 13pc of the total general revenue receipts for the current fiscal. But the present year saw a substantial surge of over 30pc in the provincial tax collection, encouraging the finance managers to increase the target for the next year.

The provincial monthly civil accounts show that the province collected Rs96.29bn, or around 60pc of the annual target, in the first three quarters of the ongoing year to March, displaying growth of 30pc over last year's collection of Rs73.96b, or 45pc of the budgeted target, in the same period. The services tax rose by 33pc.

We have achieved significant growth in tax collection by improving compliance and broadening the base without raising the tax rates or implementing new ones, the minister said. We will carry on with tax reforms in future to boost our collection, she vowed. Implementation of reforms is crucial to improve service delivery and boost development spending.

A MAN in solitude is either a god or a beast - this might be true in case of man but as far as states are concerned neither the gods nor the beasts live in solitude but has some kind of 'allies' and friends to support their interests.

On the other hand, a state like Pakistan whose foreign policy is India-centric has neither an ally nor a friend today while India is being covered by every single state whether Muslim or non-Muslim.

Our ally, the US has not only cancelled the agreed deal of F-16s but also droned the settled area of Balochistan, and is about to be tied in a holy knot with our 'adversaries' which signifies something more than the spokesperson for our foreign ministry can think about. Saudi Arabia, too, isn't happy with us on our reaction to its renewed proxy war against Iran and is willing to extend its business ties with India.

Our neighbours are turning tables on their critics and excelling their way in the world arena. China, no doubt a good friend, is realising the great dream of the silk road through 'one belt one road', which would establish it as the only power of its kind for centuries to come.

On the other hand, Prime Minister Modi has renewed the national pride of Indians and is playing his cards most shrewdly, both at home and abroad, which directly or indirectly is so far proving detrimental to Pakistan's interest.

Iran, our friend but opponent of Saudi Arabia, is gradually arising out of the annoyance caused by its 1979 revolution to the democratic West and is seen now as a possible ally both by the US (in the far-off future) and Russia. And last but not the least, Afghanistan is determined to make its future.

And in the midst of three allies and China we are dreaming of 'Naya Pakistan' in the old Pakistan where the policy of reconciliation is adored over national interests, where democracy is in danger when the issue of corruption is raised and so on.

Today Pakistan is facing a most dangerous foreign policy crisis as there is no foreign minister to be made accountable while the prime minister prefers to do the job himself from the ICU ward and to prove his love for Pakistan!


 

 

The great leap forward

IT takes less than five hours to travel by train from Shanghai to Beijing - a distance of more than 1300 kilometres - almost the same as from Karachi to Islamabad. China now has the longest network of high-speed train service in the world, running at a dizzying speed of over 300km per hour,

It is one of the major showpieces in the remarkable transformation of a country that has gone from being one of the poorest nations six decades ago to the second largest economy in the world today. China is now a superpower both in terms of the size of its economy and as a major global military force. This breathtaking progress puzzles the world.

I am on my second visit to China after a gap of more than 27 years and the country looks like a different planet. I came here for the first time in 1989 to cover the visit of the then prime minister Benazir Bhutto. By then China had already taken off on its course of economic reform that loosened state control.

Yet it still looked very much a part of the Third World trying to grapple with the political challenges that came in the wake of the opening up of the economy and consequent social changes. There were more bicycles on the streets then, unlike the luxury cars clogging the networks of expressways and flyovers now. There were few high-rise buildings that now dominate the skylines of all the big cities and towns, completely changing the landscape of the country.

China set aside its disputes with other countries in order not to deviate from its main focus on the economy.

This transformation of China from a developing country to a major global economic power has been made possible by a phenomenal economic growth rate of around 10pc over more than the past two decades. The per capita income of this country with a population of over one billion has tripled in the last 10 years. That has also helped pull more than 700 million people out of poverty. Apart from other factors, a successful population control programme has also contributed to this turnaround.

Though still ruled by the Communist Party, China has long moved away from the doctrinal socialism that formed the basis of the 1949 revolution. It has successfully experimented with a hybrid capitalist and socialist system in which private and foreign investments are equally important.

This ideology, also known as Dengism, was first developed by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s after the end of the so-called Cultural Revolution that left devastating effects on the country's economy. Deng Xiaoping did not, however, reject Marxism and Mao Zedong thought but adopted a more pragmatic approach focusing on economic development.

His theory of adapting socialism to a given Chinese situation is based on his famous maxim, It doesn't matter whether a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice. What this simply means is that it does not matter whether a person is a revolutionary or not, as long as he or she is efficient and capable of doing the job under a socialist economy. Deng is rightly described as the architect of modern China.

But this second revolution led by Deng could not have been possible without the initial socialist revolution led by Mao Zedong that destroyed the old economic, political and social order and established a socialist system. That emancipated the population, thus laying the foundation of modern China.

The 1949 revolution also liberated the country from foreign occupation, giving the Chinese people self-respect and strengthening nationalism. One of its greatest contributions was in the field of education: the literacy rate increased from 20 to 80pc in less than two decades. Illiteracy has now been completely eradicated in China. That paved the ground for the second revolution.

But the Deng revolution occurred after a massive internal struggle. The Cultural Revolution was in fact an attempt by the hardliners to oust the reformists from the communist party and they had initially succeeded in doing so. Deng and some other senior leaders were sidelined. But they soon returned to take charge and lead the party on a new reformist path.

Over the past two decades, China has completely focused its energies on economic development albeit without the Communist Party's loosening its political control, a lesson the leadership probably learnt from the collapse of the Soviet Union. That has certainly helped make the country an economic superpower. While fully protecting its sovereignty, China has refrained from being drawn into conflicts despite provocation. It set aside its disputes with other countries in order not to deviate from its main focus on the economy.

A case in point is Beijing's relations with India with whom it has a long-running border dispute. But that has not affected Beijing's trade relations with India which have risen to more than 100 billion dollars a year. Similarly, the Chinese leadership has remained calm in the face of the US policy of containment. Nothing seems to divert its attention from the economy.

There are some concerns about the growth rate coming down to an average of around 7pc over the past two years. But there are no serious worries. Most observers in Beijing describe the latest rate as the new normal. They contend that the 10pc growth rate was abnormal and that it had to settle at a rational position. However, a 7pc growth is still high compared to that achieved by most developed countries.

The slowdown of the economy may not affect China's ambitious One Belt, One Road initiative. The proposed development strategy that focuses on connectivity and cooperation between China and other countries of Europe and Asia underlines Beijing's push to take a bigger role in global affairs.

This development strategy remains a major challenge for President Xi Jinping who is arguably the most powerful Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping. The biggest challenge for this new Chinese leadership is how to take the country into the next phase of economic development and reform the existing one-party rule in line with the new generation that has much greater international exposure.


 

 

The new Great Game

THE recent India-Iran-Afghanistan agreement to develop a trade route from Chabahar to Central Asia has been portrayed by Indian commentators as having changed the historical 'Great Game' for control of the connection between South and Central Asia through Afghanistan. It has been claimed that the agreement will end India's 'isolation' from Central Asia and Pakistan's 'stranglehold' over Afghanistan and create a 'new security paradigm' and a 'geopolitical shift'.

But the Great Game has already changed. It is being played on a wider canvas with different players and rules. The power contest in Asia is now mainly between China and America, and, to a lesser extent, between America and Russia - with India, Pakistan, Iran and others in subsidiary roles. In this context, the strategic and economic implications of the tripartite agreement are likely to be limited.

Chabahar port has been on the drawing board for many years. Its main purpose was and will remain to expand Iran's oil and other trade including with India.

Implementation of the trade route to Central Asia will remain challenging until peace can be restored in Afghanistan. With the collapse of the inter-Afghan negotiations, Afghanistan is likely to witness a further escalation of conflict and chaos. Transit to Central Asia via Iran, or Pakistan, is not viable at present.

Even once the route is operational, its economic significance will remain modest. India's oil needs can be met by Iran (and Saudi Arabia). The Central Asians do not have pipelines to Chabahar; they do to China. New gas pipelines are being constructed to Europe. Their mineral resources are also flowing north, east and west; not south.

America is and will remain a major player in the new Asian Great Game.

With a population of only around 50 million, Central Asia will not become a huge market for manufactured goods. It will be twice as expensive for India to send goods to Central Asia through Chabahar than it would be overland across Pakistan. Indian goods are thus unlikely to be competitive against Chinese products shipped overland.

The strategic advantages for India are also questionable. Its influence in Afghanistan will be more dependent on Iran. Pakistan's cooperation will continue to be essential to restoring peace in Afghanistan. Indian shipping lanes to Chabahar will be vulnerable to disruption. India's limited influence in Central Asia will not dent that of Russia and China.

The new Great Game will increasingly revolve around China's One Belt, One Road vision of land and sea connections between Asia, Europe and beyond. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is the first component of this ambitious project.

In comparison to the Chabahar route, the strategic and economic implications of CPEC are enormous. It will transform China from a one- to a two-ocean power; enable a part of its $4000 billion annual trade to circumvent the Malacca straits and other potential choke points in the Indian Ocean and shorten China's supply lines to the Gulf, West Asia and Africa. For these reasons, if no other, China has a vital stake in Pakistan's strategic stability and socioeconomic development. The Chinese commitment of $46bn for CPEC projects is but the first instalment of the massive capital which China is prepared to deploy in Pakistan.

Instead of being distracted by the moves of its adversaries, Pakistan must remain focused on the implementation of CPEC. This strategic enterprise should not be allowed to be stalled or delayed by external pressure or internal politics, inefficiency or corruption. It would be wise to create a separate and independent CPEC Authority which can be a 'one-stop-shop' entrusted with achieving CPEC's enormous potential for Pakistan's development. CPEC projects must go beyond infrastructure development to encompass manufacture, consumer goods, housing, health, textiles, finance and other sectors. To this end, the interaction between Pakistani and Chinese private- and public-sector companies must be actively expanded and intensified. Some of the externally imposed limitations on CPEC investment projects, such as restrictions on 'sovereign guarantees' for debt finance, need to be removed expeditiously.

CPEC faces threats from Pakistan and China's adversaries. These will have to be met forcefully.

India's opposition has been announced openly. New Delhi will continue to utilise Afghanistan as a base to destabilise Pakistan and undermine CPEC. The recent spate of attacks on Chinese workers in Pakistan is no accident. Pakistan will have to further enhance security for them and consider direct action to remove the Afghan-based threat from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

Iran has assured that Chabahar is not designed to compete with Gwadar or CPEC. Pakistan and Iran can cooperate for mutual benefit: to end terrorism in Balochistan, expand trade, and construct the Iranian gas pipeline and a Gwadar-Chabahar economic corridor. However, Tehran often wants to run with the hare and hunt with the hound. Some recent events have sent disturbing signals which Pakistan cannot ignore.

To balance the growing Indo-Iranian relationship, Pakistan must maintain and reinforce its relationship with Saudi Arabia and Turkey. It would be in Pakistan's interest to help in giving substance and form to the 'Islamic coalition' hastily formed by Riyadh. It should also convince the GCC states of the benefits of CPEC as a path to their closer connection with China.

America is and will remain a major player in the new Asian Great Game. To bolster its strategic contest with China, the US is moving towards a military alliance with India. The Obama administration is also cooperating tactically with Iran in the fight against the militant Islamic State group in Iraq and, less clearly, in Syria. It wants Iran to help in stabilising Afghanistan. But the US-Iran relationship could again become hostile if new sanctions are imposed by the US Congress or differences arise over Iraq, Syria, Hezbollah or Israel.

For Islamabad, the major threat now is possible hostile US action to destabilise Pakistan and disrupt CPEC. Wisely, China has invited US participation in CPEC. The US has declared, perhaps diplomatically, that it is not opposed to CPEC. But the signals from Washington, as it hosts India's Modi, are ominous. The new Great Game is about to get tougher and rougher.


 

 

Making the most of CPEC

BOTH China and Pakistan consider CPEC a significant milestone - in the emerging politics of the region, it has the potential to change the strategic and geo-economic dynamics across the whole of Eurasia.

Both sides appear enthusiastic about the corridor, but for different reasons. For China, CPEC is a flagship project, an important component of its much larger One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative. For Pakistan, it is a strategic and economic game changer in the region.

However, the excitement surrounding this initiative also entails undercurrents of frustration at times. China anticipated a smooth implementation of CPEC-linked projects, but the slow pace and patchy consensus on the project within Pakistan have annoyed Beijing. The Pakistani establishment has attempted to use CPEC and its friendship with China as a strategy for balancing regional power, mainly against India, with less focus on the economic advantages of the initiative.

Despite these mixed feelings both sides can learn a lot, to their mutual benefit. So far, they have avoided taking impulsive steps which could compound frustrations. Pakistan is learning to simultaneously manage and balance internal pressures and compulsions with its foreign policy orientation. China is experiencing a new partnership; different from its African experiences, but very useful for its OBOR engagements in the region.

The Chinese success in Africa - ie how they won and executed mega infrastructure projects in many parts of the continent - is commendable. However, these ample opportunities for Chinese investors were only achieved by China's unconditional support for those countries' unsavoury regimes. Critics also point to corruption and kickbacks, which fast-tracked implementation and completion.

Maintaining consensus ensures transparency and socio-political stability.

Pakistan and South Asia are different from the African region. Although corruption is a big issue in the national discourse - and scandals such as the Panama leaks continue to destabilise the government's credibility - the government cannot use authoritarian powers to suppress the opposition, media, judiciary and, above all, the common citizen's grievances.

The political government cannot do without consensus among stakeholders, especially on national issues. In some cases, building consensus takes time but, once developed, it ensures transparency and, most importantly, socio-political stability - critical to paving the way for long-term engagements.

The Colombo Port City project is a good example of this: the project had been signed off by the previous government, but due to internal criticism and lack of transparency the new government suspended work on the project. President Maithripala Sirisena's government has recently given the go-ahead to resume the initiative - after developing consensus and making changes to the terms of the project.

Dictatorial leadership cannot build consensus on critical national issues - such regimes have triggered anti-establishment and anti-Punjab sentiments in its federating units, and have also caused socio-political frustrations which have impacted internal security. Besides the many issues of resource distribution, the Kalabagh dam is a classical example of military rulers failing to evolve consensus despite all their efforts. It suits political governments best to evolve and maintain consensus as they have previously done; the settlement of water resource distribution, national financial awards, and some critical constitutional corrections are a few recent examples.

Even on CPEC, consensus is intact because all political stakeholders are generally in agreement. If some provinces or political parties continue to have reservations, there are forums available where these issues can be discussed.

The smooth implementation of CPEC-linked projects requires that all our constitutional and legal safeguards are functional and free of bureaucratic hurdles. The government has promised incentives, such as a 'one-window operation' and coordination networks for foreign investors and stakeholders, to create a better investment climate in the country. To facilitate Chinese investors, the government could introduce a separate mechanism both on the federal and provincial levels. The provinces could accelerate the process of establishing special economic zones, which would also attract investors from other countries.

There is a need to make the Council of Common Interests more effective and functional. At the same time, parliamentary committees on CPEC should be vigilant and enhance their contributions from monitoring to actively giving advice. If needed, a special oversight committee on CPEC can be formed, made up of representatives from political parties, chambers of commerce, technocrats, and experts. Considering that security is a critical issue for the project, representatives of the security establishment can also be included.

Another issue which Chinese experts often highlight is the lack of any scientific approach in Pakistan, with indirect references to the fact that the eastern route - much more feasible from economic, security and strategic perspectives - should be prioritised. According to their rationale, a scientific approach is needed to manage costs and long routes. However, a political government cannot sell this idea as it incurs a political cost. The better approach for the government would be to bear the economic costs and to focus on both routes simultaneously. This is important, both for national unity and political stability.

Many experts rightly evaluate the strategic importance of CPEC - increasing in importance given the fluid geopolitical context of the region. The Gwadar port is important for China and Pakistan in emerging strategic scenarios in the Indian Ocean, and will give them an enormous edge over their competitors. Would it be wise to capitalise on strategic advantages only when it also holds economic opportunities - when neither comes at the other's cost?

To put it simply, it is not that Pakistan would gain strategic advantages only if it sacrificed its economic interests. China may also not favour the idea of overemphasising the strategic importance of CPEC and Gwadar, but rather use them as important markers on its blueprint for OBOR. China's strategic and economic positions would not be damaged if Pakistan continued to use its strategic advantages to balance regional politics and manage its relationship with the US.

CPEC is an experiment for both China and Pakistan. From it, China can learn how to execute OBOR in other parts of the region with similar political and social credentials. For Pakistan, it presents a test: to hold its nerves and implement CPEC without any major political and security turbulence.

After China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), China and Pakistan are making efforts to build 'health and knowledge corridor' to bring revolutionary changes in the health sector.

The health experts of Pakistan visited China last week to discuss Pakistan's health issues and next month a delegation from China will visit Pakistan to finalise the agreement regarding health corridor.

The CPEC has become one of the most important projects of the world. It is expected that the project worth of over $40 billion will change the geopolitics of the region and will bring unprecedented economic development in Pakistan. On the other hand for China the project is the first step towards fulfilling its dream of 'one belt one road' which will attach three continents i.e. Asia, Europe and Africa and its projects will be exported through this route.

Pakistani delegation headed by Vice Chancellor of the Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University (Pims) Dr Javed Akram visited China last week and discussed collaboration in health sector.

Moreover, an idea of a joint examination board was also discussed during the visit. The board will address the problems of hundreds of Pakistani doctors who have completed their education from China but could not do practice here.

Dr Akram while talking to Dawn said that during his visit to Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, detailed deliberations were held with the Chinese authorities.

We visited the Kunming Medical University and hospital. The newly built 1,300-bed hospital is totally paperless because of the use of information technology. Moreover, different transplant facilities such as kidney and liver are also provided there, he said.

We discussed student and faculty exchange programmes and decided to adopt collaborative approach to address the health issues and take steps for the capacity building of the institutions of both the countries, he said.

While replying to a question he said that currently a number of medical students, who had passed their exams from China, were not allowed to practice in Pakistan. Once the Joint Examination Board is established it will become possible to allow the students to start practice in Pakistan without going through the process of National Examination Board (NEB), he added.

NEB is conducted by Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) for those medical graduates who pass exam from abroad.

In 2012, through an Act of Parliament it was made mandatory for foreign graduates to pass the NEB for doing practice in Pakistan. However some postgraduate qualifications like diploma of American Board, FRCS (UK) or equivalent are exempted from the NEB.

By next month, a delegation of China headed by the President of Kunming Medical University Professor Lee Kong will visit Pakistan to finalise the agreements for health corridor, Dr Akram said.

We expect that health corridor will bring drastic changes in the health sector and improve the health facilities in the country which include the use of information technology in the health sector which will reduce load on the tertiary care hospitals, he said.

We will be able to link the health centers of the rural areas of the city with Pims due to which people will prefer to get treatment in their villages instead of visiting Pims for small problems and issues, he said.


 

 

The Thucydides trap

THE ancient Greek historian Thucydides theorised that when an established power encountered a rising power, a conflict between them was inevitable. Today, the US, the current global hegemon, and China, the rising power, appear to be hurtling towards the Thucydides trap.

As the former Chinese foreign policy czar, Dai Bingguo, recalled at a US-China conference, in a little over 40 years China-US relations have “produced tremendous and extraordinary outcomes”: in bilateral trade and investment, restraining threats to peace and security and addressing global problems.

However, the US now clearly perceives China’s rise as a threat to its global pre-eminence. President Obama announced a US ‘pivot’ to Asia three years ago. The pivot is now firmly under way.

American military moves to contain China have become more robust and overt in recent months.

Two-thirds of US naval power is being deployed to the Pacific. The US is building a ring of alliances with countries around China’s periphery: from South Korea to Afghanistan. It has interposed itself in China’s maritime disputes; accused China of unfair trade, cyber attacks and espionage and human rights violations; excluded China from the US-sponsored Transpacific Trade Partnership and boycotted the China-sponsored Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

American military moves to contain China have become more robust and overt in recent months.

These include: support for Japan’s militarisation; the stationing of US naval and air forces in the Philippines; aggressive naval patrolling in the South China Sea; ever closer defence cooperation with and supplies to India; pre-positioning of US military equipment and supplies in Vietnam; joint naval and military exercises with Japan, South Korea, Australia and India; an agreement with South Korea to station the sophisticated THAAD anti-missile system there; ostensibly to counter North Korea’s missile threat, but which would also enable the US to partially neutralise China’s long-range missile capabilities; and in the context of China’s assertion of its claims in the South China Sea, the hawkish, half-Japanese head of the US Pacific Command has reportedly told his troops to be ready “to fight tonight”.

The recent ex-parte award against China on the South China Sea islands dispute by The Hague Arbitration Tribunal, set up pursuant to the Philippines’ unilateral approach to the International Court, could bring the growing Sino-US tensions to a climax.

In the aforementioned speech, Dai Bingguo recalled that, at the end of the Second World War, the US had actually helped China to recover control of the South China islands from Japanese occupation, thereby acknowledging China’s historical claim. Dai said that 42 islands and reefs were ‘illegally’ occupied by the Philippines, Vietnam and others after 1970. The later US declaration, that it took no position on the issue of sovereignty over these islands, Dai said, amounted to ‘back-pedalling’. Three years ago, the US declared it had a ‘national interest’ in these disputes and encouraged their multi-lateralisation.

The Hague award has stated that China has no historical claim to several of these islands. The US asserts that this is now international law which China must observe, thus reversing its post-War position. Washington’s stance is all the more invidious since it, unlike China, is not a party to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.

China asserts that the ‘tribunal’ was constituted unilaterally; it had no jurisdiction under UNCLOS to proceed without China’s concurrence, much less to pronounce on territorial issues which are not within the scope of the convention.

The full scope of China’s response to US moves against it is as yet unclear. Given the rising pride and nationalism in China, Beijing will resist any ‘humiliation’ or concession on China’s ‘territorial integrity’.

China has announced it will soon hold extensive military exercises in sections of the South China Sea, no doubt designed to reaffirm its territorial claims. Any attempt by the US to conduct so-called ‘freedom of navigation’ forays during such exercises could trigger an early test of strength.

China will, no doubt, attempt to persuade the new Philippine president to desist from attempting to ‘implement’ The Hague award and opt for a negotiated settlement. In exchange, the Philippines could be offered extensive Chinese support for infrastructure development. If Manila spurns this offer, Beijing’s response is likely to be harsh, all the more so to ensure that others littoral states do not follow the Philippines’ example.

If Seoul proceeds to deploy the THAAD anti-missile system, China’s political and trade relations with South Korea may deteriorate significantly. Instead of sanctions, China could expand economic and defence assistance to North Korea to prevent its collapse.

Beijing’s posture towards Japan is also likely to harden. The US-Japan-South Korea military exercises could be countered by joint China-Russia naval operations in the North China Sea.

In response to growing Indo-US military cooperation, China could ‘activate’ the northern disputed border, extend its naval operations into the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, further enhance its strategic partnership with Pakistan and intensify efforts to build greater influence in Afghanistan and other South Asian states.

The escalating Sino-US rivalry will compel Pakistan to align itself even more closely with China. Consequently, Pakistan will face even greater US pressure and coercion, including on Afghanistan, terrorism, nuclear and missile issues.

The impact of a Sino-US confrontation would be global. Sino-Russian defence cooperation would intensify. The One Belt, One Road project will link China with Europe through Russia, reducing American influence. In the Middle East, China could align with anti-US states. Africa could divide between Western and Chinese blocs. In Latin America, Mexico, Brazil and some other states may be open to closer relations with China to challenge American domination. The Sino-US economic relationship, including cross-border investment and their trillion dollar trade, would decline sharply, slowing growth in both countries and the world economy and possibly igniting another global economic crisis.

Of the 15 historical cases reviewed by Dr Kissinger of established powers encountering rising rivals, 10 resulted in conflict. The US and China could yet back away from the Thucydides trap. The onus for doing so rests with Washington. Unfortunately, the anti-China populism reflected in the current US presidential campaign does not augur well for the triumph of restraint and reason.

THE China-Pakistan Economic Corridor routinely makes headlines in Pakistan, which is to be expected given the scale of this project and its importance for the country. However, there is rarely any discussion or analysis on why this corridor, and the wider One Belt, One Road project, is so crucial for China and how recent events are only increasing Beijing’s urgency.

One such event was the ruling given on July 12 on the South China Sea arbitration case, a case that was filed by the Philippines against China, challenging China’s claims over the South China Sea. The arbitration tribunal ruled that China has no “historical right” backing its claims and called on China to stop its activities in the South China Sea.

The importance of the congested and highly contested South China Sea is partly due to its rich fisheries and energy deposits, but to Beijing these waterways are quite literally a lifeline for trade and transit.

China is following the tradition of Great Powers ignoring rulings.

Disputes between China and the littoral states of the congested South China Sea have been long-standing, with Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and others looking askance at China’s claims over the Spratly and Paracel Islands, and also condemning Beijing’s construction of ‘man-made’ islands in the area. Perhaps anticipating the verdict, which rejected China’s ‘nine-dash line’ claim to most of the South China Sea, Beijing began casting doubt on the tribunal’s fairness well in advance of the verdict, even alleging that the Japanese head of the tribunal was a right-winger and thus inherently biased against China.

Predictably, China has rejected the verdict, saying it is “null and void” and has threatened to impose an air defence zone over the South China Sea. In doing so, China is following the time-honoured tradition of Great Powers ignoring rulings that do not go in their favour. The US, which is the only country in the world to not ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, has itself done so on several occasions.

Now that the verdict is in, Beijing has little choice but to try and engage in bilateral negotiations with the claimant states, but this also seems like a non-starter. The Philippines, for example, rejected an offer to engage in talks over the South China Sea, saying that doing so would not be “consistent with [their] constitution and national interest”.

In Vietnam, nationalist feelings against China have risen to such an extent that a local broadcaster took a popular Chinese drama off air after one of the actors made statements in support of China’s position.

Essentially, China has no friends in that region and even its so-called ally, North Korea, is increasingly a liability with its sabre-rattling providing a justification for the presence of US troops and also for increased military spending by states that feel threatened by Pyongyang.

But while it’s tempting to see this as a case of a raging Gulliver being tied down by Lilliputians, that wouldn’t be an accurate analogy. Backing these countries is the United States, which wants the South China Sea to remain classified as ‘international waters’ where the US Navy can operate openly. This fits perfectly with the much-talked about ‘Asian pivot’, which calls for refocusing US attention on East Asia to confront and contain a rising China. While this term was first mentioned in 2011, the policy goals it represents are long-standing and were delayed only because of the geopolitical earthquake that was 9/11 and America’s subsequent imperial adventures.

And while much is being made of Beijing’s military spending and the expansion of its navy, those opposing Beijing in the region are no military slouches either. You may be surprised to learn that Japan’s defence budget in 2015 was a whopping $41 billion, which places it at number eight in the list of top military spenders, just below India and France. Moreover, Japan’s nationalist Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has also worked to slowly erode Japan’s pacifism, passing legislation last year allowing the Japanese military to engage in overseas missions.

Further afield, India is also pleased at the discomfort the ruling has caused China. About 55pc of Indian trade passes through the South China Sea, and joint Vietnamese-Indian energy exploration ventures in these waters have also raised hackles in Beijing as has India’s support for Vietnam and the Philippines in their tussle with China.

And then there’s the behemoth that is the US Navy. Aware that it cannot hope to match the US ship for ship, Beijing has opted to emphasise anti-ship missiles and other area denial weapons systems to deter any possible aggression. None of this, however, means that China could possibly prevail against a US-backed coalition in the nightmare scenario of a naval blockade.

What this adds up to is that China is increasingly isolated and cornered in the East Asia region, to the satisfaction of strategic planners from Washington to New Delhi. This also means that the importance of CPEC, and of Pakistan, just increased manifold.

A Chinese study centre will be established at University of Peshawar to encourage research and study on Chinese languages, history and culture.

The establishment of Chinese Study and Research Centre at University of Peshawar was envisaged during the visit of Ambassador of People’s Republic of China Sun Weidong to the university, said a press release here on Thursday.

The Chinese ambassador met UoP Vice-chancellor Dr Mohammad Rasul Jan and presented him a cheque to become partner in the centre.

The centre would work under an independent director with the prime objective of encouraging and promoting research and study on Chinese languages, history and culture. It would also play role in strengthening people to people friendship between the two countries.

The centre would offer Chinese language courses, professional diploma and degree courses from the coming September. Besides frequent exchange of students and faculty, UoP and Chinese universities would execute joint research projects in the respective fields of interest.

“On the advent of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the China study centre at UoP would offer enormous help to the local industrialists by equipping them with the Chinese research and language and offering professional diplomas and degree programmes on their subject of interest,” Dr Rasul Jan told the Chinese delegation.

He said that UoP had academic linkages with three Chinese universities and would like to have exchange programmes with more universities for projects of mutual benefits.

“The establishment of China study centre at a time when both the countries are celebrating 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations is a milestone achievement,” said Sun Weidong. He added that people to people interaction was the hallmark of the existing relationship that beacame stronger with every passing day.

The ambassador said that China advocated the principle of peaceful co-existence and respected the political system of every country. He added that the essence of the time tested Pak-China relations was based on common interest and respect for each other’s sovereignty.

He said that CPEC was in the stage of implementation and in the first phase construction of one belt one road would take place that would be followed by setting up Havelian dry port and development of Gwadar Port.

He showed interest in the establishment of a Confucius Centre at the University of Peshawar in the days to come.

The delegation included Political Attache of Chinese Embassy He Liu. Dean of faculty of social sciences Dr Adnan Sarwar Khan, dean of faculty of arts and humanities Dr Minhajul Hasan, chairman of regional studies department Dr Baber Shah and treasurer of UoP Dr Yorid Ahsan Zia were also present on the occasion.


 

 

The Chinese trail

“Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come” - Victor Hugo

THE concept of balancing economic development with environmental resource conservation has been a part of global discourse for over two decades, but has remained inconclusive and vague. The year 2015, however, changed that when the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) clearly laid out globally agreed upon signposts for the future.

While much of the world is still scrambling to honour this consensus and heed the call for translating rhetoric into reality, a remarkable shift is happening in one of the most unexpected of quarters. Slowly but surely, the Chinese engine of development has been shifting gears.

Following decades of rapid development that managed to propel millions out of poverty, China is now experiencing the high and unavoidable price to be paid for ignoring environmental care. Air that you cannot breathe and water you cannot drink can quickly choke the very basis of economic progress. Realising that the existing model of ‘pollution now and solution later’ is unsustainable, not only environmentally but also financially, this engine of growth has been self-correcting its course.

It started about a decade ago when the idea of ushering in an ‘eco-civilisation’ was first discussed at the 17th National People’s Congress. This laid the ground for an economic transformation as it led to the concept being enshrined in China’s constitution in 2012. A new force had now been unleashed.

Within China, the first to take the lead on this trail were the ecologically rich provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan and Hainan, which demonstrated varying models of green development in practical terms. Subsequently, China’s model of eco-civilisation has slowly matured and crystallised over the years.

A course of self-correction has been adopted to reverse pollution.

Firstly, in addition to being social, economic and environmental in nature, its foundation also has spiritual roots. It has built upon ideas embedded deeply in Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism, and is meant to rekindle the interdependent harmony between humans and nature that all of them preach.

Secondly, the concept not only integrates the remarkable progress that the world has already made on SDGs and climate negotiations, it also takes a step further by demonstrating a model for its implementation. Within this concept, environmental conservation is not just considered an ‘add on’ to development but an integral part of development that must be mainstreamed. It has been integrated as one of the five pillars of growth in the recently announced five-year development plan for 2016-2020 - through defined plans and stated targets on forestry, national parks and the reduction of water and air pollution. All these are backed by dedicated public funds for implementation over five years.

China is aiming to export this eco-philosophy to its neighbouring region. The concept is now being integrated into the ‘One Belt, One Road’ project, which is reaching out to expand the country’s influence, trade links and economic growth to over 60 countries through the creation of an economically linked belt. The underlying objective is to export not just development, but ecologically responsible development, to trusted trading partners along the centuries-old Silk Road. In this context, it can be seen as shifting the trajectory of growth in both China and the adjoining region.

Being one of the central countries of this project, Pakistan has a rare opportunity to reap the benefits of this transformation by fully aligning the large infrastructure development currently planned along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor with environmental responsibility. This will not only ensure that its own development is climate-compatible and ecologically sustainable but will also align it with a rising global phenomenon.

Thirdly, learning a central lesson from China’s own growth model, the concept of eco-civilisation endeavours to define ‘development’ not just in terms of economic growth but also in terms of poverty reduction. This has relevance for developing countries, where capitalist models of ‘trickle-down’ economics have largely failed to effectively address the plague of ever-increasing poverty.

Finally, and most importantly, the concept envisions altering the course of global growth and influencing an entire society to think differently along a shifting paradigm - from fossil fuels to renewables, from economic capital to natural capital, from resource plunder to sustainable use, and from carbon-intensive to carbon-sensitive development.

In many ways, the future envisioned for an ‘eco-civilisation’ seems to be adequately developed and in place to align China with this shifting reality and shape a future where economic growth is balanced with environmental care. Such a prospect can be termed as the dawn of a new eco-civilisation.

The writer is a former Pakistan minister of state for environment, a global vice president of IUCN and a member of a Chinese government think tank on environment.

ANALYSING everything in its correct perspective is a great gift; the loss of perspective is akin to losing one’s way in a forest. Keeping perspective helps one walk on the straight and narrow path. Ordinary citizens normally give undeserved credit to their governments for their actions and decisions, assuming that they are the outcomes of careful considerations.

The word ‘minister’ (or wazir) conjures up the image of famed wazir, appointed to the courts of kings; the unmatched wisdom of their advice prevailing with their leaders. So what the huddle of wazirs, also known as the cabinet, decides is beyond any reproach. Governments sometimes have perspective and sometimes do not. But they have the enviable choice of presenting their case to their constituents with or without perspective. The toiling masses do not have the time to investigate further. Those with lives of ease do not care beyond massaging their baser selves. The intellectuals react depending on which side of the powers-that-be they are responding to.

China, no doubt, has remained a friend to Pakistan. It is their geopolitical compulsion as well as ours - there is no more to it. Countries’ relations are subject to change depending on the state of international affairs. During state visits, leaders describe their mutual relations in hyperbole but this is just to sound warm and sweet. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is one such example of a narrative fed to the people without any perspective.

China’s friendship is based on geopolitical compulsions.

Putting it into perspective, CPEC is part of China’s grand vision, known as the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative. This vision extends from the Baltics in Europe to Southeast Asia and from China to Africa. Trace it on the map and the road traverses all the countries in between. It is not a physical road like the Silk Road, that historic trade route from China to Europe. That old Silk Road was not like Sher Shah Suri’s road from Peshawar to Kolkata, but caravans meandering on different routes from one caravanserai to another, carrying both goods and ideas. China has accumulated $3.2 trillion in foreign exchange. It can be used both for investment and to buy influence around the world.

This is what OBOR is about.

As an official policy, OBOR is overseen by China’s powerful National Development and Reform Commission and the ministries of foreign affairs and commerce, as sanctioned by the State Council, the nation’s chief administrative body. OBOR has become the ‘in’ thing to be associated with in China’s global economic strategy. As the word ‘road’ itself implies, projects (especially those involving construction of physical infrastructure) that facilitate commerce between China and the wider global community reflect the basic spirit of OBOR. The principal difference is that China’s belt-road is not based on aid or even FDI, but on loan financing. This underscores the importance, for creditors and debtors alike, to carefully factor in risks with OBOR projects.

The recipients of OBOR initiatives in Africa are Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Eastern Europe presents the farthest geographic stretch of OBOR, and of China’s reach in historically more advanced capitalist economies. In Poland, a railway project was inaugurated in 2013. Hungary has become the first EU member-state to initiate a Chinese high-speed rail project under OBOR. Russia and China are collaborating on the massive Power of Siberia gas pipeline project. In Southeast Asia, one of the most recent OBOR rail projects to be launched is the high-speed railroad (costing $6 billion) connecting the Laotian capital of Vientiane to China. A rail project has also been completed in Indonesia.

Unsurprisingly, China has won the feasibility study for two other railway projects - Mumbai to New Delhi and New Delhi to Chennai.

Pakistan’s resource-starved government ogled at the offer of CPEC. It gloated over it as the one unmatched gift to Pakistan. Politics always overrule economics. The ruling party was, therefore, in a great hurry to negotiate these projects under secrecy, much to the chagrin of KP and Balochistan, as spending will now affect outcomes in the 2018 national elections. Despite the mad rush for project initiation and completion, it is widely understood that economic analyses for various projects have yet to be conducted. Lending under CPEC is short-term - it will have serious consequences for the current account when it is time to repay them in the not-too-distant future.

CPEC, a part of OBOR, offers great strategic advantage to China as it gains physical access to the Indian Ocean and closer proximity to Middle Eastern oil resources. Other OBOR projects around the world do not offer such advantages to China. This is a shrewd global strategic move. China’s global rivals will, of course, factor this in their countermoves.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Monday said that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was not just a game-changer for Pakistan, but would go on to transform the fate of the entire region.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar also claimed that the CPEC was not merely a $40 billion project, adding that Pakistan was expecting much more investment to flow into the country once the corridor was up and running.

Leaders of the country’s various provincial governments - as well as representatives of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) - had come together in a bid to showcase the potential of their respective areas with respect to the mega-project at the CPEC Summit and Expo, held in the capital.

Organised by the Ministry of Planning and Development, the event aimed to highlight bilateral trade and investment opportunities in different sectors of the economies of Pakistan and China.

Top leadership explores investment potential in all parts of the country

“Our region has seen a lot of conflict and deprivation in the past, and the time has come to turn a new leaf in the history for our region by bringing peace, prosperity and opportunities,” the prime minister said while inaugurating the event.

“The CPEC cannot be defined by projects or infrastructure, it is a new concept and approach in diplomacy and development based on shared goals and aspirations. The CPEC is the way of hope and future for our region.”

It was the fusion of President Xi Jinping’s ‘One-Belt One-Road’ with Pakistan’s ‘Vision 2025’, which sought to harness Pakistan’s geo-political position into geo-economic advantage by connecting the three engines of growth - South Asia, China and Central Asia, he said.

The prime minister announced that Pakistan was back in business and ready to do business with the world.

“The megawatts of electricity or kilometres of roads constructed cannot gauge its value. Its value is much bigger, much greater and the CPEC will bring new know-how to Pakistan. It broadens our technological capabilities and above all it deepens our relationship of trust and raises friendship to newer heights,” PM Sharif said.

He said the project envisioned bringing under-developed areas such as Gilgit-Baltistan, the western belt of Pakistan in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, including the Thar region of Sindh and the coastal belt of Balochistan, into the mainstream of development by providing connectivity, energy, industrial zones and employment opportunities.

PM Sharif declared that the jewel in the CPEC crown was the port city of Gwadar. The government, he said, was working on a master plan with Chinese assistance to transform Gwadar into a model smart port city of the 21st century.

Not only that, but Gwadar would have a local power source and a desalination plant facility, while a modern hospital and technical training centre for the youth, a university campus in Gwadar and Zhob along the western route would start working this year, he said.

In his remarks, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said that Pakistan had achieved its highest level of forex reserves and would soon become a choice destination for foreign direct investment.

“Pakistan is not what it was in 2013. In 2016, Pakistan has changed and the world is ready to do business with us,” the minister remarked.

In an apparent response to local critics, the minister said there was no doubt that the CPEC was going to benefit all regions of Pakistan.

The chief ministers of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan, and the AJK PM and GB chief minister also spoke at the occasion.

The performance speaks for itself. The quiet pace of progress on CPEC projects in energy, infrastructure, Gwadar and upstream and downstream industrial sectors in Pakistan has silenced detractors and started creating ripples in society.

A structured mega socio-economic plan to counter the language barrier and skill development gaps in manpower in Pakistan is lacking, but some signs of adjustment to the evolving new reality of active Chinese involvement in the economy and society are visible.

Information collected from random private and public sources have brought to light some interesting facts.

There are roughly about eight to 10,000 Chinese nationals working in various capacities in multiple CPEC projects in the country. With the large influx of Chinese all over the country several hotels and motels have hired Chinese speaking hospitality officers to cater to potential clientele. Some have adjusted their menus to suit the taste of Chinese guests.

The hoteliers did not share data but did confirm that the ratio of room occupancy of Chinese guests has altered since 2013.“It would be safe to say on an average about 25-30pc rooms are now occupied by long staying Chinese guests”, a senior hotel manager of a five-star hotel in Karachi told Dawn.

According to a Pakistani diplomat who returned from a posting in Beijing recently, there is a thrust towards strengthening faculty and student exchange programmes between both public and private education institutions of the two countries, in anticipation of a much greater social interaction in the future.

The initially reluctant private sector is now actively pursuing it to be a part of the great game

“From what I heard even some private schools in Islamabad have introduced Chinese as a second language in their curriculum”, he said, adding that some 8,000-10,000 Pakistani student are currently studying in Chinese universities. “All Pakistani graduates of Chinese universities are being hired by scores of Chinese companies opening offices here”, he said.

Dr Zahir Shah, Project Director/Coordinator CPEC at the China Pakistan Economic Corridor Secretariat, ministry of planning, development and reform, accepted that efforts fell short of demand but said several working groups dealing with varied aspects of CPEC meet regularly to coordinate, push through required adjustments and iron out irritants.

Talking to Dawn on the phone from Islamabad he marked the enormity of the multi-faceted task of creating an enabling environment. “We are stunned by their work culture and their speed. Yes, Pakistani society has yet to absorb the meaning of being part of the Chinese One Belt, One Road (OBOR) vision. We expect close to a million jobs will be created in the short run. The full extent of the long run impact is hard to comprehend at this point”, he said, talking hastily as he headed to a CPEC seminar in Gilgit.

He admitted that there were capacity related issues and confirmed that 50 Pakistani universities are initiating exchange programmes with Chinese institutions.

Officers in the Chinese embassy in Islamabad were accessible and all praise for the cooperation and assistance they received from Pakistan. They expressed satisfaction over the progress of multiple projects and were highly optimistic of the development trajectory ahead but declined to come on record. They mentioned websites where information that China wishes to share with the media is posted.

The website has an exhaustive photo gallery covering several hundred CPEC related events and project sites and a series of statements made by the leaders of the two countries. It also has an updated progress report on all eight logistic infrastructure projects, 22 energy projects, 10 Gwadar city and six industrial projects.

According to the monitoring report, roughly on an average 30pc overall work has been completed. In the energy sector the 50MW Dawood Wind Farm is near completion, while work on eight projects - that include the 660MW Port Qasim Coal-fired Power Plant, the 660MW Sahiwal Coal-fired Power Plant, the 330MW Engro Thar Coal-fired Power Plant and the Surface Mine in Block 11 of Thar Coal Field, the 900MW Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park in Bhawalpur, the 100MW Jhimpir Wind Farm, the 50MW Sachal Wind Farm, the 720MW Karot Hydro power project and the Suki Kinari Hydropower project (60pc work complete) - is in progress.

In the transport infrastructure 2 projects: the KKH Phase11 (the Havelian-Thakot Section 120km) and the Karachi-Lahore Motorway (Sukkur-Multan Section 392 km) have finished 60pc of the work, while 40pc work on the Joint feasibility study for the upgradation of the ML1 and the establishment of the Havelian Dryport has been completed. Nearly 15pc of the other projects have been completed.

In Gwadar Port City a primary school is now ready. Gwadar Eastbay Expressway 19km, connecting Gwadar to Mehran coastal highway and Gwadar New International Airport has progressed by 40pc, the Gwadar Free Zone is half way through at 50pc and the rest are at initial stages.

The Lahore Orange Line Metro train has reached 60pc completion, the Optic Fibre Cable from Rawalpindi to Khunjrab, 50pc, and the Gwadar-Nababshah LNG terminal and pipeline 40pc.

The leaders of the PML-N government are thrilled by the pace of progress, focused on the political capital generated by the enormous Chinese investment under CPEC in Pakistan. The initially reluctant private sector is now actively pursuing the great game.

Pakistani society, however, it seemed has yet to absorb the full meaning of the drift towards the East and make adjustments to capitalise on economic opportunities thrown up by increasing stake of little understood friend, mighty China.

Water and Power Development Authority member (power) Badrul Munir Murtaza says no public sector hydel project is the part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

“The government may include Diamer Basha and Bunji dams in the project or may plan some other project at a later stage,” Mr Murtaza told reporters at the launch of Pakistan chapter of renowned Chinese company -- the China National Electric Engineering Company (CNEEC) -- at a local hotel on Thursday.

Chinese Consulate Consul General Yu Boren told reporters China gave the CPEC importance and the corridor would surely boost Pakistan’s economy.

“The two countries’ history of relation is unique; China is helping Pakistan through the CPEC which has projects worth $46 billion. And it is all due to the Chinese president who always regards relation with Pakistan very special one,” he added.

He said the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant would start power generation by the mid of next year.

Punjab Energy Secretary Asad Rehman Gilani said the government would award projects to those companies that fulfill the criteria laid down under the law.

“We welcome the launch of CNEEC’s Pakistan chapter. The company may enter into any of our hydel, bio mass projects’ bidding subject to fulfilling the criteria,” he added.

Company’s Pakistan chapter chairman Wu Guisheng pledged to strengthen friendship between the people of Pakistan and China.

“We’ve contributed to the energy sector of Pakistan by utilising their knowledge and management skills,” he said.

He said the training of Pakistani engineers had been a focal agenda of the CNEEC for the future projects.

“We will further strengthen the cooperation with the Punjab government in the energy and infrastructure construction sectors and will execute the key projects of the National Transmission and Dispatch Company,” he added.

CPEC policy: China has great importance towards its relations with Pakistan and will continue to further promote cooperation in different sectors. Pakistan-China ties have touched new horizons and avenues of trade and economic cooperation.

Chinese Consul General Yu Boren said this at a seminar “CPEC opportunities”, arranged by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), regional Lahore office, on Thursday.

Punjab Secretary for Industries Khalid Sherdil said the provincial government was planning to introduce a CPEC policy soon for streamlining its activities. The government was also considering to have an institutional framework to execute the $46 billion CPEC under a long term plan till 2030.

He said of the $46 billion to be invested under the CPEC initiative in Pakistan, road, infrastructure and energy projects had already been in the active implementation phase while the industries sector was being collaborated.

The government was working on one window which would enhance business activities, Mr Sherdil said, adding three industrial estates of Punjab had been declared special economic zones.

He said Chunian was also proposed to be the next industrial estate which would be good location for the CPEC promotion.

FPCCI Vice President and Regional Chairman Mian Rehman Aziz said the CPEC was a long-term systematic project and was gradually entering the phase of full implementation from planning.

He said Pakistan was facing political and administrative instability, insurgency, terrorism, ideological conflicts and separatist movements which might impact the CPEC.

He envisaged if the CPEC was to be a success, efforts with political reforms at home needed to become more adept at diplomacy and supplement.

Mr Aziz said Chinese were taking various initiatives for CPEC promotion in line with the “Belt and Road” national strategy of China, together with various national and international institutions all over the globe.

Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif says Chinese President Xi Jinping’s one-belt-one-road vision is earning support and opposition equally in the world as a lobbying is active against it in a neighbouring country. The China-Pak Economic Corridor (CPEC) is also a part of the vision and “while there is a huge support for his splendid vision, opposition to it has also intensified”.

Shahbaz was speaking at a function held in connection with Chief Minister’s Chinese Language Scholarship Programme, Shahbaz Sharif Merit Scholarship Programme and to honour 18 boy and girl students obtaining more than 500 marks out of 505 in Class IX examination at Chief Minister Office on Friday. He hoped the students of Chinese language would promote CPEC, which would stay forever and billions of dollars more would be invested in the project.

Says metro train to be completed on time

“There is a lobby against this project in a neighbouring country and for this reason a seaport is being built in front of Pakistan’s seaport,” he said while referring to Iran’s Chabahar port just 100km from Gwadar. He said there was collusion between India and some other countries against the CPEC as they feel threatened by the project and the Indian prime minister had spoken against Balochistan too. He said Pakistan would move ahead of India due to strengthening of its economy as a result of the CPEC.

Referring to the Orange Line Metro Train in Lahore, the chief minister claimed that it was the most transparent public project and Chinese government also had complete confidence in its transparency that’s why it had given billions of rupees for it. He hoped that despite problems and challenges, the project would be completed on time.

Shahbaz added though the work on the project had stopped at some places after the order of the Lahore High Court but it was being implemented round the clock at other places and an appeal was being filed before the Supreme Court against the LHC decision.


 

 

CPEC and looking northwest

PAKISTAN is under constant diplomatic stress, and needs to come up with some effective responses to counter Indian diplomatic coercion. The country is not lacking in policy and intellectual strength. However, there is a very simple reason for its defensive diplomatic posture: the presence of non-state actors on its soil. These entities have become a strategic burden for Pakistan and consume a considerable amount of its diplomatic and political energies at the regional and global levels. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s speech at the United Nations General Assembly could have been more potent and effective had the attack on the Uri military camp not taken place. Though nothing has been proven yet as to who was responsible, India has reacted as usual by blaming Pakistan.

The recent stand-off with India over the violence in India-held Kashmir, and China’s support for Pakistan’s stance on the issue were also expected. However, China is also concerned about non-state actors based in Pakistan and considers them a major threat to the security of the economic corridor. The role of these elements in fanning extremist tendencies in the country is also viewed with disquiet by our CPEC partner. The impression that a few banned organisations are as happy about CPEC as the average Pakistani does not please Beijing’s intelligentsia. It was irritating for them when the head of a banned organisation announced that his group would provide security to the corridor.

Afghanistan and Iran are not just our neighbours but can also become partners in the economic corridor.

In the stressful environment created by India’s coercive diplomacy, what could be a source of optimism for Pakistan? The answer is simple: CPEC. The security and political establishments are both obsessed with CPEC for different reasons. While the security establishment is calculating the strategic advantages it will offer, the ruling party is trying to extract maximum electoral campaign leverage from it. Both are treating CPEC as the ultimate solution to most of the country’s problems, mainly in the economic sphere. But is it too simplistic to view it as a ‘game changer’?

CPEC could indeed be a game changer, but a comprehensive review of internal and regional policies is a prerequisite to enjoy all of CPEC’s perceived advantages. Internally, apart from squeezing the space for violent non-state actors, political consensus is an important factor. Continuous political dialogue among all stakeholders, an active Council of Common Interests, and functional parliamentary and bilateral oversight bodies are imperative for CPEC’s potential to materialise. However, a review of regional policies is equally critical.

No doubt, India’s ‘Act East’ diplomatic strategy is obsessively becoming Pakistan-centric, in which it considers Afghanistan and Iran as vital partners to hurt Pakistan. Meanwhile, although the latter has been struggling to acquire strategic depth in Afghanistan for many decades, its reactive responses in that country have instead given India the advantage. What Pakistan needs is a new ‘north-western policy’ to reduce the strategic stress in its northwest as well as to secure CPEC and increase its geoeconomic potential. The policy should focus not only on the relationship with Afghanistan and Iran but also beyond.

There should be no doubt that regional stability linked with peace in Afghanistan and Iran has an important role in consolidating such gains. Afghanistan and Iran are not merely neighbours of Pakistan but can also become partners in CPEC. Many experts in Beijing believe in such a scenario and its potential to guarantee regional stability.

The Pakistan-Iran relationship should now move beyond memorandums of understanding. Both countries have signed hundreds of MoUs for energy, economic, military and cultural cooperation since the 1980s but very few have materialised. On paper, both countries enjoy friendly and brotherly relations but practically speaking, irritants continue to bedevil their relations. Iran has enormous potential to become a functional partner in CPEC as it is already part of the Chinese Silk Road Economic Belt. The Silk Road train, which connects China’s coastal Zhejiang province with Iran, is a manifestation of the two nations’ shared aspirations. The first Silk Road train arrived in Tehran on Feb 15 this year after travelling over 10,000km. As per calculated assessments, Iran’s involvement in the initiative will boost Pakistan’s economic potential and it was hoped that the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline could become a reality with Chinese funding.

Iranian partnership in CPEC does not require much diplomatic effort, as the country has already shown its willingness to join the project. A statement earlier by the Iranian ambassador to Pakistan was significant, for in it he indicated that the Chabahar port agreement between Iran, India and Afghanistan was “not finished” and “not limited” to these three countries. He also revealed that the offer to build Chabahar port had first been extended to Pakistan and China, but neither had expressed an interest. The Iranian partnership in CPEC could also make it a partner in securing the corridor from non-state actors in Pakistani Balochistan. To achieve this, however, Islamabad has to review its Middle East policy. Pakistan’s relations with Saudi Arabia should not affect its relations with its neighbours and vice versa.

It is important that voices calling for normalising relations with Afghanistan are increasing in Pakistan. The political parties, civil society, and intelligentsia have become vocal supporters of a complete review of bilateral relations between the two neighbours. It cannot yet be said with certainty how the security establishment will look at this growing internal consensus, but this is the time to evolve a realistic framework of engagement with Afghanistan. Islamabad will have to take the initiative.

Certainly, winning the hearts and minds of Afghans would not be an easy task because of historical baggage and multiple other factors. Even though the internal situation in Afghanistan would be quite frustrating, this engagement is essential for improving Pakistan’s internal security, enhancing the potential of CPEC, denying space to hostile countries in Afghanistan and, most importantly, for improving its own international image. Afghanistan is the key to Pakistan’s better relations with the West. Pakistan can capitalise on a long-term friendship treaty with Afghanistan.

Although reconciliation with its north-western neighbours would not be easy, Pakistan will be a major beneficiary of the process. It will enhance its internal security and economic growth, especially at a time when trilateral, quadrilateral and multilateral initiatives have failed to bring stability to the region.


 

 

Treaty in trouble

In the wake of the Uri incident, India has launched a campaign to ‘punish’ Pakistan. The Indian offensive has proceeded swiftly on the diplomatic, political, economic and, as of this writing, militaristic fronts.

An early salvo is India’s aggressive stance on the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960. Last week, India said it would increase its water withdrawals from three rivers that flow through India to Pakistan to the maximum levels permitted under the treaty. India is also considering building dams on the Jhelum which flows through the Kashmir Valley before entering Pakistan. Both measures threaten serious economic and humanitarian harm for Pakistan.

See: Indus Waters Treaty rides out latest crisis

India has further claimed it will cease participating in meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission, set up under the IWT, until “terror comes to an end”. It has decided to indefinitely suspend the regular meetings of the Indus water commissioners of India and Pakistan. Each of these measures is a potential breach of the treaty, and Pakistan should prepare its case for the Permanent Court of Arbitration, should any of these materialise.

The basic elements of such a case are straightforward. First, the IWT does not permit India to unilaterally abrogate its obligations. Such an abrogation would be a material breach, since the treaty has no termination date. Treaties of this kind exist in perpetuity unless rescinded or modified by both parties through mutual consent. Second, Pakistan has approached the World Bank (a party to the treaty) - so there is an ongoing dispute or controversy. In the Nicaragua case, the US was not allowed to retract its consent to the International Court of Justice’s jurisdiction once a dispute arose and was being entertained by the court. This was so even though, unlike the IWT, the treaty at issue there allowed the US to withdraw its consent to ICJ jurisdiction.

If India breaches or abrogates the Indus Waters Treaty, it would be a violation of international law.

There is some suggestion that India might justify a breach of the IWT or other actions in bad faith by claiming it is ‘retaliating’ to some supposed misstep by Pakistan. As a threshold matter, there has been no independent inquiry of any such accusation, and curiously, no interest on India’s part in allowing one. However, even assuming, for argument’s sake, that such claims were tenable, they would not justify the type of collateral ‘retaliation’ India seems to contemplate. Put simply, two wrongs would not make a right. International law has parallel obligations, and treaties such as the IWT are self-contained. The breach of one treaty or obligation does not allow the aggrieved state to respond by breaching a different treaty, or other international law principles.

But if India jettisoned the law, it would still need to consider the political and economic fallout. First, the IWT was based on negotiations and compromise. India should realise that if the IWT were to go away, Pakistan’s claim to the rivers that were given to India (Beas, Ravi and Sutlej) would be revived. Absent the treaty, Pakistan, as a lower riparian state, would have strong rights on these waters.

Second, the IWT does not exist in a vacuum. By breaching it, India would also likely breach the Shimla Agreement, by going against its ‘guiding principles’. At a minimum, it would be working against its spirit. A breach of the Shimla pact will likely be costlier for India than Pakistan. It could lead to a chain reaction, with tit-for-tat withdrawals by both countries from operational arrangements and security agreements. Given these states’ nuclear capabilities, such an unravelling would pose a significant threat to international peace and security.

Third, aside from Pakistan’s reaction, India should carefully consider its reputational costs in the international community. India has a number of similar treaties with other countries, like Myanmar and Bangladesh. The international community will rightly be concerned by India’s cavalier treatment of its international law obligations.

Albatrosses notwithstanding, India continues to escalate. It pulled out of the now cancelled Saarc summit and has convened a meeting to discuss stripping Pakistan of its Most Favoured Nation trade status. Modi and External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj have also given back-to-back inflammatory speeches labelling Pakistan a “terror state” or “state sponsor of terrorism.” It is hard to imagine what sort of endgame such cowboy posturing is meant to achieve.

One possibility is that by ‘retaliating’ through planned IWT violations, India is creating a pretext for undermining CPEC. Critical Chinese investments in Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK depend on the river water India now threatens. A salient example is the Neelum-Jhelum hydropower plant. If such a pretext is at play, then India must consider not only Pakistan’s reaction, but Chinese concerns as well. Just as India is an upper riparian state to Pakistan, China is an upper riparian to India. Any sabotage of the One Belt, One Road project can trigger a reaction from China.

India has also claimed having undertaken “surgical strikes” inside Pakistan. This is a deeply troubling development, and raises the possibility that India could use restricted water supply as a preparatory step for further hostile action. This context adds another dimension of international law. The waters awarded to Pakistan under the IWT are its natural resource. Stopping them or diverting them is a direct breach of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by India, because it violates the territorial integrity and political independence of Pakistan. Targeting a state’s natural resources, installations, assets, or citizens extraterritorially is a serious violation of international law. Numerous aggrieved states have responded to such violations with force.

A breach of Article 2(4) would trigger Pakistan’s inherent right to self-defence. Pakistan should make good-faith diplomatic and legal efforts to dissuade India from such a course. However, as a last resort, and complying with the requirements of necessity and proportionality under the law of self-defence, Pakistan would be within its rights to use not only “necessary countermeasures”, but also force, to remove any headworks, dams, or other diversionary installations in India-held Kashmir that illegally restrict the flow of these rivers into its territory.


 

 

Globalisation at a crossroads

Globalisation, however useful and surely at far from the end of its journey, has produced winners and losers.

It has not been able to do enough to remove much of the economic disparity between, and within, nations whose capital spending is skewed towards the growth of markets at the cost of citizen-centred development.

The current phase of faltering globalisation is not working for both developed and emerging markets as efficiently as it did before the financial crisis of 2007-08.

Taking a zigzag course charted by a varying blend of protectionism, free trade and voluntary decisions based on national autonomy, globalisation can transform the current faltering international market into an inclusive and equitable world economy

Traditional sources of international investment are shrinking while trillions of dollars in cash/financial assets are stored in offshore islands. Export markets are not growing fast enough as the global economic recovery is at best ‘fragile’, and a higher growth trajectory so far elusive. IMF experts describe it as ‘an era of low interest rate and low growth.’

These circumstances are now inducing many countries to look inwards, with the focus shifting from integrating into international markets towards re-balancing domestic economies.

Worldwide citizens’ protest against conventional wisdom, that has brought globalisation to its present state, has widened to proposed investment treaties between developed countries. Tens of thousands of Germans protested last month against a proposed trade deal between the European Union and the United States of America.

On October 1, the Economist reproduced, on its title page, some of the slogans raised in frequent public demonstrations: ‘Globalism = the elite; Migrant out; Country first; Protect our jobs, Gag the so-called experts; Fair trade not free trade.’ etc.

All these protests and ideas are signals for the citizen’s democracy to return, going beyond the electorate mandate. This will lead to a greater say of the voiceless on how things are managed in their country, and the community of nations, for the public good.

Such voices are also being echoed in the US general elections. US Presidential candidate Donald Trump says that unfair trade has destroyed jobs for the Americans and Hillary Clinton is now critical of the TTP, a deal which she helped to negotiate.

Focused on financial globalisation and the financial-isation of economies, the US has neglected manufacturing and job creation. Cheaper imports from developing states helped America keep a low cost of living - by their national standards - while wages have remained constant, or fallen in real terms.

There is a growing resistance to this policy, and that of immigration, because of rising unemployment and under-employment - not fully recorded in official jobless figures. Ground realities are changing.

The flaws in globalisation have produced a backlash of nationalism and protectionism. This requires a paradigm shift in globalisation policies.

Similarly, regional groupings are also largely stuck in time and space, with their future not looking very bright at the moment. With a clear majority in the referendum (direct democracy) the citizens of UK, which is one of the most open economies, have delivered a shock to Brussels’ ambitions by their decision to leave the EU. Social exclusion has led to the pronounced self-assertion of common citizens.

Something similar but not that significant has happened in the case of Saarc. After kicking up tensions with Pakistan, India decided late last month not to participate in the Saarc Summit scheduled to be held in Islamabad; cumulating in the summit being postponed.

The major impediment in promoting regional cooperation in South Asia is the dispute between India and Pakistan that revolves around self-determination for Kashmiris (and the allied problems of militancy and sharing of river waters). But India is concerned merely with low profile insurgencies, which crop up from time to time, and their fallout outside the occupied territory, while ignoring their root cause.

While most formal regional groupings are largely not responding adequately to the needs of the time, unlike India, China has unleashed the potential for regional cooperation by launching a ‘One belt one road’ vision that includes CPEC.

The latest to show interest in CPEC are Saudi Arabia and Iran. The economic disparity between and within nations may be seen as a major problem, or considered as a common agenda, in the pursuit of regional cooperation or re-balanced globalisation.

Regional projects offer global businesses and international financial institutions opportunities to invest.

Apart from a surge in self-assertion by nations and their citizens, high-tech is disrupting old ways of doing business, changing the mode in which markets work, and impacting the daily life of common citizens differently.

The European Union can benefit from the experience of the breakup of the Union of (Soviet Socialist) Republics in 1991. It was a union in name only; Moscow managed the Union economy on behalf of the Republics under the concept of ‘one economy’, while extending its sway to include its allies in Eastern Europe.

The denial of national autonomy coupled with deep-seated financial crisis made the Soviet Union dysfunctional and brought about its demise.

Instead of integrating the EU member- states’ economies, with so much uneven levels of development among them, into a single market, Germany-led Brussels should return to what Britain initially advocated: working on a common market. There is a need to revert to a voluntary, common agenda and refrain from destroying democracy and national autonomy (as was done to enforce austerity in Greece).

Having lost much of its social utility, market democracy cannot deliver a robust European Union.

However, taking a zigzag course charted by a varying blend of protectionism, free trade and voluntary decisions based on national autonomy, globalisation can transform the current faltering international market into an inclusive and equitable world economy.


 

 

CPEC - the talent perspective

AGame changer, economic boom, and Asian tiger - these terms have become routine when either talking or reading about the China Pakistan Economic Corridor.

China’s OBOR (one belt one road) is an ambitious goal and the CPEC a small part of that grand vision. It just so happens that Pakistan borders China, and the nearest deep sea port for China is Gwadar. Getting access to Gwadar is their top priority.

But let’s forget China for a moment and focus on Pakistan. What will Pakistan achieve from the CPEC? For starters, there is no transparency as far as commercial issues are concerned.

Do we know the break down in contribution from the Chinese public and private sectors? What are the terms and conditions for the loans being taken from Chinese banks? What is the rate of return agreed for these various investments? What are the forms of procurement for the various projects under the CPEC - are these mostly BOT (build - operate - transfer) types?

For energy projects, what will this cost the end consumer when generation starts? Have tariffs been worked out? Do we know what we will end up paying?

These details form part of the planning and appraisal stage of any infrastructure project. The minimum we can ask for is transparency. The Planning Commission needs to make sure all this information is readily available on their website.

No country, no matter how big, can make use of economic gains in the long run if it doesn’t have a key resource - the human capital

It seems the planning minister, Mr Ahsan Iqbal, is working hard with his Chinese counterparts to make sure the CPEC progresses as planned - but if we believe in true democracy, then it is imperative that transparency be ensured and all relevant information be made available on a public domain.

Unfortunately, the details available on the Planning Commission’s website are, at best, basic and don’t provide a great deal of information on the financial aspects.

Now let’s discuss another aspect of the project.

Assuming the CPEC will bring a lot of economic prosperity, are we, as a nation, capable of sustaining the economic growth that will supposedly come along with these interventions? Do we have an educated, healthy and capable workforce that can sustain and multiply the economic gains from it? The answer is a definite no.

No country, no matter how big its economic gains are, can make use of these gains in the long run if it doesn’t have the key resource - the human capital. Human development in Pakistan is abysmal to say the least, and there is hardly any work being undertaken to address this probnlem.

Our human development indicators are not encouraging, and the current policies don’t give us any hope for improvement.

The Global Education Monitoring Report 2016, published by the Unesco, paints an extremely depressing picture vis a vis the education sector in Pakistan.

Similarly the Global Hunger Index 2016 placed Pakistan at a dismal rank of 107 (out of 119 developing countries), confirming 22pc of the population is under-nourished.

These findings should set off a few alarm bells in the highest echelons of power. However, given our priorities, I seriously doubt this will actually happen. It is high time our policymakers genuinely start crafting policies that are related to achieving human development improvements.

We have had, at best, extremely short lived economic booms in the past, because these could not be sustained due to a lack of resources. I fear history will be repeating itself when the time comes for the fruition of the the CPEC project, but unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be any willingness to learn from past experience.

Attempts to improve economic gains without investing in human development will lead to another temporary phase of growth, and then back to square one. We need to invest in people in order to ensure sustainable economic growth.

Just investing in physical assets will get us nowhere in the long run. It is very easy to target short-term goals, especially when political cycles run for five years. The CPEC is a long term project and we are at a crossroads where we need to make the right decisions in order to ensure that the true potential of the project is utilised.

This will mean investing in people and institutions to serve the long term betterment of the country. Human capital is an essential input for economic growth, and should be seen as a means to generating future growth.

Various studies in the field of development economics have suggested that economic growth can only be sustained if human development levels are first improved, and not the other way around.

Every investment comes at a cost, and the public has every right to know what that cost is.

There is no denying the fact that the CPEC has the potential to transform many lives - but having the potential doesn’t necessarily mean we will achieve it without getting the basics right.

Human development is required to drive the economic growth envisaged via the CPEC or we will keep on going into vicious circles of ‘boom and gloom’.

DEPUTY chief of the Chinese embassy Zhao Lijian explained the other day the share of four provinces in the $51.50bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project. According to him, there are only four provinces -- Balochistan, Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. According to Zhao, at least 16 projects under the CPEC are related to Balochistan, 13 projects to Sindh, 12 projects to Punjab and eight projects are related to KP.

China has already invested $14bn in 30 early-harvest projects to be completed under the CPEC, a flagship project of the ‘one belt one road’ initiative launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping.. But there is no share or parts of projects related to Gilgit-Baltistan as such while the file related to Gilgit-Skardu Road is still going round desks and offices without being approved. The PML-N government is doing nothing’ for the prosperity of Gilgit-Baltistan.

THE One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative mainly consists of two major components: one is overland, based on the traditional Silk Road economic belt and the other is seaborne (maritime silk road).

Under its initiative, there is a chain of projects for free trade routes linking the Baltic Sea with the Pacific Ocean through roads, railways and sea routes.

Its projects are financed through the 50-member Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

The US considers OBOR to be a threat to its imperialist intentions. The US will employ all means, fair or foul, to impede and to contain China from challenging its lasting hegemony in world politics.

India scuffles traditionally with China and feels ill at ease with the time-tested China-Pakistan strategic partnership and the two countries’ numerous joint ventures in economic and security spheres.

Owning to long-time implications of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor for both Pakistan and China, the US and India seem hell-bent upon going out of the way for doing everything they can to sabotage this mega-project.

The government must ensure that Pakistani firms are given opportunities to interact closely with Chinese companies and are able to avail maximum benefits under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, LCCI President Abdul Basit said on Tuesday.

He was addressing a delegation, led by Brigadier Hammad and comprising of 44 representatives from 25 countries, which visited the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI). Mr Basit said CPEC is part of the ‘One Belt, One Road’ plan which aims to establish close land and maritime links among 60 plus countries across Asia and Europe.

“Once it is complete, estimated volume of intra-trade among these countries would reach $2.5 trillion,” he said.

He said Gwadar Port is going to play a pivotal role in the development of western region of China. Infrastructure development currently going on in Pakistan has kick started the process of economic recovery, he added.

These projects will accelerate investment, trade and economic growth in Pakistan, and help stabilise the country, he noted.

LCCI Vice President Muhammad Nasir Hameed Khan said the growing gap between revenue and expenditure has increased the vulnerability of fiscal framework, requiring the federal and provincial governments to tighten the belt with a view to putting economy on track.

Brigadier Hammad spoke about the importance of the private sector for the economic turnaround of the country.

Various topics including the Kalabagh Dam, regional trade, energy, women empowerment, orange train and bilateral trade with African region were also discussed.

THE China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is expected to create 700,000 new jobs in Pakistan.

One must understand that making an investment of $46bn is not a free gift, but an effective buying of power. When looking at the impact on economy, it is clear that Pakistan will mostly be a transit point. This project will save thousands of kilometres of transit between China and other countries, as it will be much easier for China to ship the products manufactured in its industries to the rest of the world.

The project comes at the one-belt-one-road (21st century Silk Road) project proposed by China. If everything goes according to the plan, the CPEC would give some of these benefits to Pakistan’s economy. Gwadar would come into existence as a modern port, unemployment will decrease, there will be fewer security concerns and GDP will go up, besides a greater inflow of forex.

So Pakistan is critically dependent on the CPEC and cannot afford losing it in any case. The government machinery, media, and the military should unanimously support it and focus on guaranteeing the success of the CPEC.

THE One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative mainly consists of two major components: one is overland, based on the traditional Silk Road economic belt, and the other is seaborne (the maritime silk road).

Under this initiative, there is a chain of projects for free-trade routes linking the Baltic Sea with the Pacific Ocean through roads, railways and sea routes. These projects are financed by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

The US considers OBOR a threat to its intentions. The US will employ all means to impede and contain China to prevent it from challenging its hegemony in world politics. India scuffles traditionally with China and is uneasy about the time-tested China-Pakistan strategic partnership and the two countries’ numerous joint ventures in the economic and security spheres.

Owing to CPEC’s long-time implications for both Pakistan and China, the US and India seem to be going out of their way to do what they can to stop this project.


 

 

Future of shipping industry uncertain, says UNCTAD

United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) says that seaborne shipments passed 10 billion tonnes for the first time ever in 2015, up 2.1 per cent from 9.8bn tonnes the year before, noting that this is the slowest pace of growth in the industry since 2009 and that future growth looks uncertain.

The ‘Review of Maritime Transport 2016’ released on Monday by UNCTAD says that shipping carried more than 80pc of the world’s goods by volume in 2015, and its slow growth reflects sluggish global trade, albeit with variations in the different sectors.

According to the review, shipments expanded by 2.1pc, a pace notably slower than the historical average. The tanker trade segment recorded its best performance since 2008.Shipping of oil recorded its best performance since 2008, thanks to low oil prices, ample supply and stable demand.

But shipping’s overall growth was dragged down by the limited growth of dry bulk commodity trade, in particular coal and iron ore, and by the poor performance of container shipping, which carries about 95pc of the world’s manufactured goods.

Despite this slow growth, the industry’s carrying capacity continued to grow, jumping 3.5 per cent to 1.8 billion deadweight tons in 2015 and pushing freight rates down to record lows.

Falling demand from China, low commodity prices, over supply of ships and geopolitical uncertainties in some oil and gas producing countries all add to the current downside risks affecting shipping.

According to the report, the ‘One belt, One Road’ initiative by China, the Japanese initiative of ‘Partnership for Quality Infrastructure’ in Asia and the expanded Panama Canal and Suez Canal, all have the potential to affect seaborne trade, reshape world shipping networks and generate business opportunities.

“The push for ever larger ships is at the root of the industry’s problems, there’s just not enough cargo right now to fill the newly acquired, bigger vessels,” said UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi on the launch of the report.

Shipping companies have sought to reduce their operating costs by building and buying ever larger ships. But this may prove costly for developing countries, where transport costs are already higher than in other regions.

Developing countries account for ever larger shares of international shipping. By volume, they accounted for 60pc of goods loaded and 62pc of goods unloaded in 2015.

With the exception of a few Asian countries such as China, most developing country ports lack the infrastructure for bigger ships. So unless they spend heavily on upgrading their ports, developing countries face fewer port calls, less competitive markets and higher shipping costs.

APROPOS the article ‘CPEC - the talent perspective’ (Oct-24). The writer has correctly summarised the fact that ‘no country, no matter how big or small, can make use of economic gains in the long-run if it doesn’t have a key resource, which is the human capital’.

China’s OBOR Policy (one belt one road) is an ambitious and far-reaching policy measure which will lead to economic integration between Europe, Central and South Asia, Mongolia, Russia and, finally, China, as a land-based economic union comprised of scores of nation-states.

It is for sure that sooner or later, a completed and fully optimised and energied CPEC project will usher in unprecedented economic change in Pakistan. However, in the absence of healthy human development indicators in Pakistan, we could see the trickle-down effects of the project falter, unless a well-developed and motivated work-force can take on and maintain the project.

I would suggest the following: 1) improvement in the literacy rate, 2) greater participation of women and the minorities in the key sectors, 3) the establishment of leading hospitals and centres of educational excellence on CPEC routes, so that there is a clear effort towards developing vital linkages between transport, commerce, infrastructure, energy and human resources and 4) population control activities should be boosted.

Speakers at a policy dialogue on day two of the international conference on “Inter-Regional Connectivity: South Asia and Central Asia” agreed that enhancing people-to-people contact and institutional collaborations, especially among universities of Asian states, was the best way forward to inter- and intra-regional connectivity.

They recommended the policymakers of South Asia and Central Asia states that since benefits of geo-economics were immense, the economic affairs should take precedence over bilateral disputes between the states.

They said a permanent think-tank should be established where academicians and researchers could debate on the emerging issues of inter-regional connectivity.

Prof Dr Tahir Kamran said there was a need for effective and joint measures by the states to counter ethnic hostilities and religious extremism which figured strongly in the limited progress on inter-regional connectivity till date.

Conference chairman Prof Dr Khalid Manzoor Butt said there was a strong realisation among the Central Asian and South Asian states for inter-regional economic cooperation.

He said for the realisation of this goal, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) could be effectively exploited to create an integrative line between Pakistan and Central Asian states, particularly Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan via Afghanistan.

He said these republics should be involved in this profit-seeking venture to create an environment for the comprehensive, sustainable and uniform progress for peace and stability in the whole region.

Mr Ching Chgang said the South Asia itself had serious strategic unbalance.

“India suspects China’s plan of ‘One Belt One Road’ and refuses to cooperate even in literal or oral way.”

Dr Sinderpal Singh said that sovereignty and the integrity of territorial borders had been core concerns for the post-colonial states since their inception as independent states.

Earlier, 32 research papers were presented at the three technical sessions of the conference.

China and Pakistan have launched a direct rail and sea freight service, with the first cargo train departing from Yunnan, an inland province in southwest China, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

According to Dawn.com, a cargo train loaded with 500 tonnes of commodities left Kunming, capital of Yunnan, for port city of Guangzhou from where the cargo will be loaded on ships and transported to Karachi, marking the opening of the new route.

“The route helps local businesses connect with the world market,” a representative from the New Silk Road Yunnan Limited said. The new service is said to reduce the transport cost by over 50 per cent.

The new rail, sea freight service will cut logistics cost, including that of transport, by 50pc compared to past services, the news agency reported.

The service is a part of China’s Maritime Silk Road initiative of which the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project (CPEC) is an extension.

Pakistan and China kicked off first trade activities under CPEC in October as over a hundred Chinese containers arrived at the Sust port in Hunza, following clearance from customs. The containers were headed to Gwadar.

The CPEC is a 3,000-kilometre network of roads, railways and pipelines to transport oil and gas from Gwadar Port to Kashgar city, northwestern China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.

Proposed by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang during his visit to Pakistan in May 2013, the CPEC will act as a bridge for the new Maritime Silk Route that envisages linking three billion people in Asia, Africa and Europe.

An official agreement on the corridor was signed between the two countries in May this year during President Xi Jinping’s historic visit to Pakistan.

Balochistan Chief Minister Nawab Sanaullah Khan Zehri has said that with efforts being made by security forces, people’s cooperation and effective policies formulated by the government, the law and order situation in the province has considerably improved.

He said that security for the China-Pakistan Econo­mic Corridor (CPEC) would be ensured because the project would pave the way for development of the entire region.

Addressing the inaugural session of a two-day seminar held in Gwadar on CPEC Socioeconomic Developm­ent organised by the Pakistan Navy on Tuesday, he said that peace and development were interlinked and the government was making allout efforts to restore peace and order in the province for speedy development of Balochistan.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was due to inaugurate the seminar but he could not reach Gwadar because of inclement weather.

Minister for Ports and Shipping Mir Hasil Khan Bizenjo, the Chief of the Naval Staff, the Air Chief Marshal, Chinese Ambas­sa­dor to Pakistan Sun Weid­ong, Commander Southern Command Lt Gen Aamir Riaz and other civil, military and foreign dignitaries attended the seminar.

Mr Zehri said the government had created a special division to ensure security of Gwadar and the CPEC. A project to make Gwadar a safe city had already been approved and required funds released, he added.

He said the CPEC had got primary importance in the future development as it was part of China’s gigantic project One Belt One Road (OBOR).

“The OBOR project creates a way towards a just world order in comparison with the colonial world order,” he said.

The CM noted that the project would create over 700,000 direct jobs by 2030 and add 2-2.5 per cent to the country’s annual economic growth.

Task force

In order to ensure security of the CPEC and the Gwadar port, the Pakistan Navy on Tuesday set up Task Force-88 in the port city.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Zubair Mahmood Hayat lauded the initiative taken by the navy in establishing a dedicated task force for the maritime security of CPEC.

He said the navy’s initiative would contribute significantly towards the success of CPEC.

He acknowledged the role being played by the navy in ensuring a safe and secure maritime environment which is an essential pre-requisite for maritime economy to flourish.

“The role of the navy is deeply embedded in the maritime operationalisation of CPEC as it will be required to shoulder greater responsibilities to ensure the protection of the growing maritime trade and provide security to our sea lanes,” said Gen Hayat.

The centrepiece of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is Gwadar it is the way forward for Pakistan into the 21st century, said Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed while addressing the concluding session of the two-day International Maritime Conference (IMC) on Wednesday.

Talking about Gwadar and Chabahar, Iran, he said that both cities were sister ports. He added that it was important to have road and rail connectivity between the two countries.

He said the Pakistan Navy’s role in maritime security and CPEC was pivotal and there was a need to make policies for maritime economy.

He complimented the navy on establishing Task Force-88 for CPEC’s security, holding and pushing out an Indian submarine from Pakistan’s EEZ and the extension of the continental shelf.

The conference was organised by the Pakistan Navy in coordination with the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform and parliamentary committee on CPEC.

The theme of the conference was: CPEC and Gwadar Port as Harbinger of Regional Integration and Maritime Economic Development. It was aimed at examining the politico-strategic, maritime economic and security dimensions of the project along with challenges and opportunities arising in the economic domain from its implementation.

On day two of the conference, the opening session on maritime security started with a keynote address by Prof Xu Ming, the executive director of Glorious Sun Institute of Management at Donghua University.

According to the professor, CPEC has great strategic design which will greatly benefit both Pakistan and China.

Vice Chief of the Naval Staff Vice Admiral Khan Hasham Bin Siddique chaired the opening session as moderator.

Andrew Small, a senior transatlantic fellow, presented a paper on CPEC and the emerging security paradigm in the Indian Ocean. He said that CPEC was unique in a sense that it was a power settler in the region and, thus, shall be accessible to all states and one should refrains counterproductive competition.

Retired Vice Admiral Asaf Humayun spoke on the importance of maritime security and role of the navy.

He said that keeping in view the enhanced spectrum of threats due to hybrid warfare by adversaries, there was a dire need to augment the capabilities of the Pakistan Navy and Maritime Security Agency to fulfil the needs of a multilayered defence system for an effective seaward defence of CPEC and Gwadar Port.

“The Pakistan Navy needs to enhance interaction with the People’s Liberation Army Navy. A full-fledged naval base at Gwadar is inevitable,” he added.

Retired Vice Admiral Iftikhar Ahmed Rao presented the last paper of the session on geo-politics and maritime security. He said Gwadar was the nucleus of all the big game ‘One Belt One Road (OBOR)’.

He said CPEC will be just an extension of the Karakoram Highway without Gwadar Port “as it’s the sea part which makes CPEC global”.

Therefore, he added, the traditional mentality that land outweighs sea must be abandoned.

Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Mohammad Zakaullah thanked all the participants, speakers and foreign dignitaries for making the conference a success and achieving objectives set forth in raising awareness and making recommendations.

He said the raising ceremony of Task Force-88 marked the resolve of the Pakistan Navy to provide a safe and secure maritime environment for CPEC, trade and Gwadar Port.

He added that the navy was being strengthened with the full support of the government of Pakistan.

The naval chief explained that Gwadar Port was not in competition with any other port but was better for the entire region as it would increase the volume of trade.

The conference was attended by Federal Minister for Ports and Shipping Mir Hasil Khan Bezenjo, provincial ministers, Iranian Ambassador to Turkey Ali Reza Bikdeli, former naval chief, members of the parliamentary committee on CPEC, foreign delegates, local dignitaries and government officials.


 

 

The tame tiger

IN the midst of major global transitions, Pakistan confronts multiple challenges: domestic discord, terrorism, Indian hostility and subversion, Afghan chaos and American pressure. The low energy response of Pakistan’s ruling classes to these challenges displays an absence of self-confidence and an assumption that Pakistan’s destiny will be determined by forces and factors other than ourselves.

Such attitudes are ill-suited to the world’s fifth largest country by population; one defended by the sixth largest, nuclear equipped, armed forces; with an economy growing at 5pc annually despite terrorist violence, political turmoil and dysfunctional governance.

It is universally acknowledged that Pakistanis are a resilient and resourceful people. Yet Pakistan has become a ‘soft state’ because its elites have embraced selfish goals nationally and a subservient posture internationally.

Over the decades, our ruling classes have become inured to the patronage of our Cold War ‘ally’, the United States, and other rich ‘benefactors’. They cannot contemplate the consequences of cutting the umbilical cord of external dependency. For most of Pakistan’s ‘common’ people, who do not benefit from this largesse, the impact of the oft-threatened termination of external financial or political support would be marginal and bearable.

Pakistan’s elites have embraced selfish goals nationally and a subservient posture internationally.

If the interests of the elite are set aside and national interest guides policy exclusively, Pakistan has the intrinsic capacity to withstand external pressure, overcome most of its present challenges and exploit the vast opportunities offered by the current strategic transition in world affairs.

In Pakistan today, domestic terrorism and violent extremism can be eliminated if the National Action Plan is implemented without regard to the political umbrellas that protect some of these violent elements.

Action against the TTP safe havens in Afghan­istan is held back by concern about America’s reaction. Yet, unless the US-Nato forces themselves eliminate these safe havens, Pakistan will have to do so if it is to stop India’s subversion from Afghan territory.

The Kabul government can surely be ‘persuaded’ to stop its constant abuse and perfidious collaboration with India against Pakistan if Islamabad utilises its considerable leverage. Once Kabul is cooperative, the Afghan Taliban, including the Haqqanis, should be either convinced to join a peace dialogue or ejected totally from Pakistan’s territory. Pakistan does not need ‘strategic depth’; it has nuclear weapons.

India is a hegemonist power. If it is to preserve the rationale for its creation, Pakistan cannot accept Indian domination. It must maintain credible nuclear and conventional deterrence but avoid war with India. However, until the Kashmir dispute is resolved, a conflict could be triggered by a popular Kashmiri revolt like the present one. If India imposes a war on Pakistan, the latter should not rely entirely on the threat of nuclear retaliation. India could also be defeated conventionally with the help of our people.

Somewhere in our foreign ministry’s archives is the record of a conversation between the then foreign minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and China’s premier Chou En-lai soon after the 1965 war. When Bhutto explained that Pakistan’s offensive on Akhoor had to be halted and its forces redeployed to protect Lahore after India attacked across the border, the Chinese premier opined that Pakistan should not have redeployed. Pakistani forces, he said, would have been welcomed in Kashmir; on the other hand, the people of Lahore would have fought Indian occupation on the streets and, with this people’s struggle, ‘you would have made your nation.’ There is a lesson here for our strategists.

There is considerable anxiety in Islamabad about US policy under Trump. Despite the prime minister’s effusive phone conversation with Trump, Pakistan is likely to suffer collateral damage from the growing US rivalry with China and its strategic partnership with India. However, unless the US seeks Pakistan’s submission to Indian domination or attempts to neutralise its nuclear deterrence, a cooperative or at least non-hostile relationship can be established with Washington. If appropriately negotiated, common ground can be found in combating terrorism, on Afghanistan, reciprocal nuclear restraint with India and mutually beneficial investment and economic cooperation.

China’s emergence as a global economic and military power offers a historic opportunity for Pakistan. It must be grasped with both hands. The CPEC project is critical, economically and strategically, for Pakistan. If pursued with vision, the opportunity can encompass: investment in all sectors of the Pakistan economy; rapid modernisation of Pakistan’s defence capabilities; stabilisation of Afghanistan; and creation of an economic network under the One Belt, One Road initiative integrating Pakistan with Iran, the GCC, Central Asia and Russia, apart from China.

Yet Pakistan should not rely on China or any other country for its development. The Pakistani state has to play a central role. Some important goals that Islamabad can secure are:

One, achieve financial independence. Tax revenues can be doubled, from the present 9pc of GDP to the global norm of 18pc. Savings of 1-2pc of the federal budget can be realised by divesting major loss-making government corporations. Pakistan’s capital markets can be enlarged to provide local development finance. The additional fiscal capacity can be used to eliminate extreme poverty, expand education and health programmes, support small farmers and small and medium enterprises.

Two, adopt a ‘Pakistan first’ industrial policy and reverse the unilateral disarmament of the country’s trade regime. Nascent industries need to be nurtured through higher tariffs and a clampdown on smuggling. They can meet the high domestic demand for consumer and durable goods, which is the main driver of Pakistan’s growth and, once competitive, contribute to expanding Pakistan’s dismally small exports.

Three, support agriculture. This sector still supports 60pc of Pakistan’s population. Our crop yields are one-eighth of those in industrial countries. With adequate financial and technical support, especially to smaller farmers, Pakistan can emerge as a regional breadbasket.

Improved governance is essential. In today’s globalised world, no country can progress without an efficient bureaucracy. Pakistan’s administrators should be functionally competent, competitively chosen, handsomely remunerated and fully accountable.

None of these goals can be adequately achieved without decisive national leadership. Our electoral democracy, chained to feudal and industrial power structures, requires to be reformed to enable clean and competent leaders to secure office. Only then will the Pakistani ‘tiger’ be able to leave the cage in which it has been confined.


 

 

CPEC: trade prospects

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor comprises a collection of road, rail, and pipeline projects currently under construction to connect Kashgar in China with Gwadar in Pakistan.

The project intends to rapidly expand and upgrade Pakistan’s infrastructure, as well as deepen and broaden its economic links with the People’s Republic of China.

The CPEC will affect Pakistan’s trade flows through multiple channels. First, it will reduce behind- the- border trade costs and bring about a shift in the modes of transportation.

Second, it will strengthen economic integration with the world’s largest trading nation, China.

Finally, it was give a boost to intra-country trade within Pakistan.

More than 86pc of the country’s exports occur through sea (column 4), the use of air and land transport is relatively limited (Table 1).

While Pakistan has access to the sea only through Karachi, its manufacturing is unevenly distributed in the hinterlands. Owing to long internal transportation, the country’s geography becomes a natural non-policy barrier to trade through sea.

Shipping a standard freight container’s load from Sialkot to Karachi involves internal transportation of more than 1,000 kilometres. These high costs of internal transportation potentially act as an implicit tax on exports and put firms at a comparative disadvantage in international markets.

The CPEC project will provide a network of road and railways to link remote manufacturing facilities to the Karachi and Gwadar seaports. The improved connectivity will reduce the costs of transportation and curtail travel time.

Furthermore not only will it enhance competitiveness of existing firms, it will also incentivise exports.

Moreover the project will also lead to the expansion of the export product set. For instance, Pakistan’s northern areas produce vegetables and fruits, such as apples, apricots and cherries. But due to a lack of good connectivity, most of this produce cannot be exported.

The CPEC will link the northern areas to airports in Peshawar, Rawalpindi, and Lahore. This will give a boost to the export of agricultural

commodities, as most of these products are transported by air owing to their perishable nature.

This improved connectivity to sea port and airports is just one aspect of the CPEC’s influence on trade flows. Another important change would occur in the modes of shipment (Table 1).

A large fraction of Pakistan’s trade with China $16bn occurs through the sea route: 97pc through sea, 2pc by air and 1pc by land.

The CPEC would bring a shift in the modes of transportation. A substantial fraction of trade with China will be diverted to the land route following the completion of the project. While sea transport is relatively cheap, road transport is the cheapest.

Moreover, it will link the country to the One-Belt-One-Road project and provide direct access to the markets of Central Asia and Europe as well. It may be noted that essentially the CPEC is not a bilateral project but has regional dimensions.

Second, the CPEC will give a tremendous boost to Pakistan’s trade with China.

The landscape of international trade has changed drastically in the past decade as the centre of gravity of production and trade has shifted towards Asia. China has emerged as one of the largest trading nations in the world. Last year, of the total world trade of $19tr, China alone accounted for more than 10pc.

Because of China’s emergence as a factory of the world, most developed and developing countries have re-oriented their trade towards it. Recently, after taking over as the Prime Minister, Teresa May’s first port of call of was Beijing because, in the wake of Brexit, the UK is keen to deepen its trade relations with this large economy.

Being a neighbouring country, Pakistan is well placed to strengthen its trade relationship with China. Trade between two countries follow Newton’s law of gravity in that it is directly proportional to the mass of the countries (GDP) and inversely proportional to distance.

Physical distance and associated travel time between China and Pakistan is going to fall drastically due to this land route, and the GDP of both economies will rise sharply; both factors boosting bilateral trade.

Many studies suggest that a 1pc increase in the income of an importing nation increases the trade of the exporting country by 1pc as well. Therefore, the gains in trade will occur not only from the reduction in distance and travel time but through the channel of engagement with the larger market of China as well.

Besides the improvement in international trade flows, a substantial shift is expected in the intra-country trade between various regions of Pakistan.

Pakistan’s firms sell two-third of their output in the local market. This domestic trade is highly concentrated in various geographical regions. For instance, Karachi based firms sell large quantities in Karachi; the same is true for those based in Lahore or Faisalabad.

This pattern will change with the improvement in regional connectivity. The construction of high speed railways in Japan enabled many firms to outsource production to suppliers in remote parts of the country to reduce labour costs.

Transit development will bring about an economic boom in relatively under developed areas of the country as well.

In conclusion, the CPEC will reduce the cost of doing business in Pakistan and improve competitiveness of its firms. This reduction in behind-the-border trade costs will give a boost to trade flows and increase integration with China.

However, to exploit the full potential of the CPEC, the country needs to focus on reducing trade costs at the border by rationalising tariffs, and those beyond the border, by negotiating trade agreements.


 

 

'Vibrant Saarc necessary to benefit from regional connectivity schemes'

Noted Nepalese scholar and international law expert Dr Yubaraj Sangroula on Monday urged the South Asian states to make Saarc a vibrant and viable organisation to reap the advantages of regional connectivity schemes such as China's One-Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, which also includes the mega project of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

The Nepalese scholar, who is currently visiting Pakistan, cautioned that with a 'dysfunctional' South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc), China has to deal with each of the South Asian countries, which was an onerous task.

He expressed these views at an exclusive talk on 'Changing regional scenario and cooperation among South Asian countries,' hosted by Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS).

Nepalese scholar says with a 'dysfunctional' Saarc, China has to deal with each South Asian country separately

Dr Sangroula said many South Asian countries were entering new relations with China. For one, China has offered generous proposals in the region: CPEC being the much-talked about example in Pakistan.

But China is also investing in other countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh.

Yet, as of now, China has to deal with these South Asian countries separately, a situation not much beneficial to both Saarc and China.

He said while all the South Asian countries were working in the same direction individually why they did not work together.

Former foreign secretary Inamul Haq, who chaired the session, said before addressing regional issues Pakistan needed to set its own house in order.

'If our foreign investment rate is going down, unemployment rate is high, how can we negotiate with other countries. The government should be tackling these issues first to fight its case on international fronts,' he added.

In reply to a question, he said it appears China wants regional and inter-regional cooperation as evident from OBOR.

He said the governments in Pakistan and India were strong enough and would not allow people to influence their policies. Importantly, the Indian army has influence on the Indian government, he added.

To come up with one voice, Dr Sangroula called for making Saarc functional. If that happens, the relations of these countries with China will further improve to the benefit of the entire Saarc.

He questioned the rationale of not doing so.

Already, India is a member of BRICS, which includes China, with which the South Asian countries such as Pakistan are partnering on economic initiatives.

To make Saarc functional, Dr Sangroula called for taking several steps aimed at engaging people of the South Asian countries, especially their academics, think tanks and journalists.

He envisioned Saarc be made 'peoples' association,' which serves as a complimentary institute to the existing bilateral and multilateral forums.

He took a critical note on the Saarc charter, which has made Saarc a community of South Asia countries rather than of the peoples.

PIPS director Mohammad Amir Rana reminded that only recently attempts had been made to disconnect Pakistan from South Asia when Afghanistan, Bangladesh and India refused to participate in the Saarc summit in Pakistan. He called upon addressing this reality.


 

 

A vision of connectivity

PRESIDENT Donald Trump of the US has shaken the geopolitical landscape of the world in such a way that many nations are struggling to adjust. At present, world politics are quite fluid, which has created more space for Chinese President Xi Jinping to materialise his dream of regional connectivity.

America's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has triggered a process of regional realignments. Some TPP-linked nations, including Japan, India, Vietnam, Australia, and Singapore, are considering prospects for a broader regional security and economic coalition. These nations fear the growth of Chinese influence in the area. Other regions, including the Middle East and central and South Asia, are also reviewing their geopolitical priorities and exploring new avenues of regional cooperation. Changing regional politics are suitable for the growth of the Chinese One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative.

What exactly does the OBOR notion hold? It will provide connectivity in emerging geo-economics with all trade routes leading to China. It will have geostrategic advantages for China and OBOR partners but most importantly, it will foster new regional awakenings beyond cultural, ethnic, historical and civilisational connections among nations.

This is prime time for Pakistan to review the notion of its regional consciousness. As far as this country is concerned, amongst many, it is part of two major regional alliances: the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).

The SCO is a broader alliance against common security threats, from extremism to narcotics; Pakistan is going to be its functional member in the near future. Full membership will not allow the country to get the benefit of collective advantages of the alliance but to evolve closer economic and strategic relations with different members of the SCO. Saarc is a critical regional alliance, as it perceives not only common economic and political interests but has also emotional and civilisational context for member states.

However, apart from geographical proximity, South Asian nations share little in common. Many scholars even raise the question whether something like 'South Asianness' exists between them. Even if there is some cohesion, can common cultural values and civilisational links transform into a regional bond of geo-economic and political cooperation?

Our social and political elite has to grow out of its obsession with 'South Asianness'.

No doubt South Asian nations share some civilisational and religious traditions, but their ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious diversities have been sources of nationalism in all of them. Each South Asian nation has unique and diverse cultural, ethnic and religious patterns. Some of these expressions might be common to a few nations but in other customs and traditions, they are entirely different. The Saarc website also shows that each nation has different cultural expressions, which is reflected in their dress codes, foods, and customs.

One may argue that people from the same ethnicity could be divided across borders in South Asia such as Punjabis, Bengalis, Tamils, Pakhtuns, the Baloch, etc, but most of these ethnicities have evolved their own cultural and social expressions and feel less proximity with their ethnic fellows across the borders.

The Saarc crisis also shows that South Asian nations must find some other common ground based on mutual economic and political interests. The Indian media and many of its academics have already declared Saarc a dead body. The initiators of the regional forum also appear disinterested. Bangladesh is debating joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations forum. Sri Lanka sees no value in being part of Saarc and feels more proximity with the Asean nations. The disintegration of Saarc has started and South Asianness is losing its context. And even if it holds together, it appears difficult for Saarc to make any difference in the region.

Saarc has been a non-political forum. On the demand of India, a clause was included that bilateral political issues and conflicts will not be discussed here - but India itself exploited the forum for political purposes. The prime objective of Saarc was the promotion of the welfare of the peoples of South Asia and improvement in their quality of life; but it has achieved very little in this regard. India also has attempted a minus-Pakistan formula and is exploring options for alternative regional alliances such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation.

Saarc is history now, and Pakistan must explore new avenues for regional cooperation. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a part of OBOR provides many opportunities to forge regional and bilateral economic and political ties with South Asian, central Asian and Indian Ocean nations. Pakistan can take the initiative of promoting economic cooperation among Arabian Sea nations including Iran, Oman and Yemen, and consider prospects for a border-sea nations' alliance among Arab states and a few South Asian nations, including Sri Lanka and the Maldives. A similar equation can be found in western and northern neighbours, mainly Afghanistan and Iran. To maximise the benefits of CPEC and gain more economic and political advantages, Pakistan needs to do some out-of-the-box thinking.

The changing geopolitical arena will have multiple advantages for the country, but Pakistan's social and political elite has to grow out of its obsession with South Asianness. Similarly, the security and political leadership has to rationalise its ties with Arab countries. What is needed is a comprehensive review of the approach to the Middle East. Joining the 39-nation alliance led by Saudi Arabia may not be a bad idea if it will convert into a security, economic and political forum based on the common interests of all members. However, this should not come at the cost of Pakistan's relations with its immediate neighbour Iran, which also offers enormous potential for economic cooperation. Better bilateral ties can be maintained with the US, Europe, and the rest of the world while prioritising regional connectivity. This is the lesson Pakistan can learn from the OBOR initiative and supplement it with its own vision of connectivity.


 

 

'Rigid stances on terrorism, Kashmir derailing rapprochement attempts'

Rapprochement eludes Pakistan and India because the two sides cannot agree on issues such as the Kashmir dispute and cross-border terrorism, speakers from the two countries told a seminar held on Thursday.

The panel discussion on 'Pakistan-India Peace Process and Sharing of Experience on Governance and Democracy', hosted by the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), featured a candid discussion between Indian and Pakistani speakers, who laid bare the unease that underlies relations between both countries.

Sundheera Kulkarni, a politician and columnist who served as an aide to former Indian Prime Minister Atal Vajpayee, said that both Pakistan and India lacked statesmen with a mindset for bringing the two countries together. He said that at the time of partition, many in India thought Pakistan would not survive for long, a belief the people of Pakistan had proven wrong.

Calling the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) a 'game-changer', Mr Kulkarni said that in order to make economic 'miracles' possible, Pakistan must ensure peace, stability and good governance.

Speakers discuss Saarc fiasco, alleged Indian support for TTP as impediments to regional peace, development

CPEC can transform South Asia, he said, adding that he believed in a trilateral partnership between India, Pakistan and China for CPEC, though India's concerns over the corridor passing through Gilgit-Baltistan will need to be addressed.

Mr Kulkarni said that four major issues needed to be addressed in order to make rapprochement between India and Pakistan a possibility; the first being the Kashmir dispute. At present, he said, both countries claimed rightful ownership of the territory when they needed to accept that the entire Jammu and Kashmir territory belongs to neither.

The second issue, he said, was that of terrorism. The Pakistani judiciary and government seemed reluctant to try suspects thought to be responsible for the Mumbai attacks, he said, adding that both countries needed to work on the issue together, considering the number of lives lost to terrorism on both sides of the border.

The treatment of minorities, he said, was the third issue to be addressed. The 200 million-strong Muslim population in India cannot be called a minority. He said it was 'shameful' that Muslims in India and Hindus in Pakistan were harassed.

He said the lack of economic integration between both countries was another issue and again suggested India should be made part of CPEC and that Pakistan be included in the One Belt One Road initiative between Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar.

Taking the stage, former Pakistani foreign secretary Riaz Hussain Khokhar said Pakistan was ready to build strong ties with India, but New Delhi's policy to isolate Pakistan could not lead to friendly relations, he said.

He criticised India for calling the Kashmir dispute an internal issue and termed Delhi's concerns over CPEC, identified by Mr Kulkarni, 'irrelevant'.

He recalled the distrust between both countries, criticised India's role in sabotaging the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) conference and blamed it for making Saarc an ineffective organisation.

'The reality is that India has never been serious about talks. We may say we want peace, but we cannot ignore the skirmishes on the line of control, nor can the plight of the Kashmiris be ignored,' he said.

Terrorism is a consequence and not the cause of the issues separating India and Pakistan, he said, adding that issues existed between the two countries before the war on terrorism.

Senior journalist Saleem Safi said there are two routes for CPEC, with the western one being short and less populated and the eastern being longer and more populated.

'We keep hearing the Pakistani prime minister saying that CPEC is about regional connectivity. The eastern route is preferred because it connects with India', he said.

He also referred to Major General Amir Riaz's invitation to India for joining CPEC and said India has been busy derailing CPEC and sponsoring proxies to destabilise the project.

Mr Safi then spoke of Islamic militants who had been under the patronage of Pakistan and that Pakistan was now suffering due to its ill-devised policies. He wondered if India was now playing the role Pakistan used to and supporting the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. 'If the groups supported by Pakistan were not loyal to Pakistan, how will they remain loyal to India?' he asked.

Senator Mushahid Hussein Sayed suggested back-channel negotiations to bridge gaps between the two countries, adding that India should stop opposing Saarc and play a positive role.

Referring to reports on Kashmir from Indian sources, he said that Yashwant Sinha, a former Indian finance minster and senior BJP leader who headed a five-member Delhi group which had recently visited Jammu and Kashmir, had expressed the opinion that Kashmiris were no longer afraid of India, or of tyranny.

The report suggests that concerned Indian authorities should talk to the Hizbul Mujahideen, he said, and that three parties should be involved in the process - India, Pakistan and Kashmir.

ECO summit begins today with pledge to expand trade

A sense of purpose and renewal prevails among Economic Cooperation Organisa­tion leaders as they gather in Islamabad to participate in the ECO's 13th summit on Wednesday where they are expected to pledge expansion of trade and economic relations and connectivity in the region.

But Pakistan has an additional reason to celebrate the occasion as it will help in dispelling the impression of growing isolation, particularly after most South Asian countries opted out of last year's Saarc summit following India's example, which had been at odds with Pakistan over Kashmir a situation that had been exacerbated by the Uri military camp attack.

This time tensions with Afghanistan, which flared up because of a row over terrorist sanctuaries just ahead of the ECO summit, gave Pakistani hosts a few tense moments, but luckily Kabul agreed to join, due to other regional considerations, albeit at a lower level. A bigger fear was a possible no-show by Iranian Presi­dent Hassan Rouhani, whose memories of last year's bilateral trip spoiled by allegations of the captured Indian spy having lived in Iran, were still fresh. He too, nevertheless, put all that aside and decided to come over.

China invited as special guest in view of extra emphasis on connectivity

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will inaugurate the summit, which is being participated by heads of government/state of eight of the 10 countries.

Uzbekistan is, meanwhile, sending its deputy prime minister, whereas Afghanistan decided to have a lower level representation.

China has been invited as a special guest in view of extra emphasis at the summit on connectivity and integration.

Prime Minister Sharif told Executive Vice Foreign Minister of China Yesui Zhang, who is visiting Islamabad for the summit, that plans for enhancing connectivity in the ECO region were 'convergent with China's One-Belt-One-Road and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor initiative.'

In a video message on the eve of the summit, Mr Sharif said: 'I have firm conviction that expanded connectivity, enhanced trade and deeper economic cooperation would transform our region into a bastion of progress, prosperity and peace. … Pakistan would be more than happy to provide ECO states connectivity through its ports.'

The summit, taking place after a gap of five years, coincides with the 25th anniversary of the expansion of the bloc established in 1985. The summit's theme is 'Connectivity for Regional Prosperity'. Discussions at the meeting will focus on prospects of cooperation in the fields of connectivity, trade, transport and energy.

Islamabad Declaration would be adopted at the conclusion of the summit. Senior officials of the participating countries had prepared the draft declaration, which has now been endorsed by the Council of Ministers comprising foreign ministers for adoption at the summit.

Pre-summit meetings have been taking place in Islamabad since Feb 26.

The Council of Ministers also adopted the ECO Vision 2025 that sets policy guidelines and priorities for the organisation for the next eight years.

Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz, while speaking at the Council of Ministers, said long-term prospects of the ECO depended on renewing the necessary political will of all member states and finding common ground in promoting effective regional cooperation and on establishment of efficient and effective institutions which could transfer actual benefits to all member states.

Stressing cooperation, he said: 'Global peace, stability and prosperity cannot be achieved in silos in the inter-connected world of today.'

The ECO has turned 32, but has little success to its account due to lack of political commitment of member states, absence of complementarities among regional economies, trade and non-trade barriers and inadequate transport linkages.

Leaders had begun arriving in Islamabad on Tuesday for attending the summit. Till the filing of the report, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Sooronbay Sharipovitch Jeenbekov had reached Islamabad.

Strict security measures have been put in place in the federal capital for the summit and the roads leading to the summit venue have been closed to traffic. A public holiday has been announced in the federal capital on the occasion of the summit. The security cover has been tighter because of the recent wave of terror attacks which hit different parts of the country.


 

 

' China , Pakistan should expect enormous challenges to CPEC'

The impact of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the result of the United States presidential election on South Asia were discussed at a seminar held on Tuesday.

A roundtable discussion was organised by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) and the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), on the subject 'New Geopolitics and the Region'.

CICIR Director Hu Shisheng, during the discussion, said CPEC was not just a mega-project but a pilot project of China's One Belt One Road initative. Given the massive nature of the project, he said, China and Pakistan should expect enormous challenges.

Rountable discussion held on impact of CPEC, Trump administration on South Asia

'CPEC is very important for China and it would never like it to fail, as some countries may wish so,' he said, adding that one of China's basic goals is to help Pakistan stand on its own economically. He said pre-CPEC relations between the two countries were military-related and political in nature.

Mr Hu said China is suffering from economic overcapacity, and is compelled to export part of its industrial capacity to countries such as Pakistan - industrial zones under CPEC are supposed to play a crucial role in this respect.

He added that CPEC can be connected to Iran's Chabahar port, as the guiding principle of China's One Belt One Road initiative is inclusiveness, which stands in contrast to India's approach of excluding and isolating Pakistan from regional initiatives and platforms.

CRSS consultant Arshad Abbasi noted the matter of disproportionately expensive financial conditions on CPEC projects, saying the costs of CPEC projects are much higher than the terms and conditions of similar development projects China has signed with Myanmar and other countries.

Mr Abbasi suggested a revision of the pricing mechanism for all CPEC projects by China and Pakistan.

While discussing US President Donald Trump's policies regarding South Asia, Mr Hu suggested that the administration would scale back American engagement in Afghanistan, and the consequently the responsibility to deal with the Afghan matter would fall on countries in the region, such as China and Pakistan.

Another speaker, former ambassador Mian Sanaullah, also discussed Mr Trump's South Asia policy, saying the US president has not said much about the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, nor met any of their top leaders.

He believed that the new president may not be good for Pakistan because of his obsession with China, which could bring the US closer to India in an effort to balance and counter China.

'I personally think a tough time is coming in US-Pakistan relations,' Mr Sanaullah said.

Former ambassador Qazi Humayun said the Kabul government and the US are pressuring Pakistan to help break the stalemate between the Taliban and Kabul in favour of the latter, but this would not be possible because Pakistan knows that the government in Kabul is predominantly controlled by Tajiks, to the disadvantage of Pakhtuns, who make up the country's ethnic majority - around 40pc.

He said a lasting solution to the Afghan problem would require proper representation of other ethnic groups in any settlement.

Former finance secretary Waqar Masood said even though Mr Trump was dismissive of Pakistan during the election campaign, his policy toward the country is not yet clear.

He said the administration would increase military spending and employ tax cuts, which would lead to a financial deficit.

Speakers at a seminar on Wednesday explored the regional scenario under the new United States presidential administration and the external and internal challenges to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

The seminar, titled 'Changing Regional Scenario and China Pakistan Economic Corridor', was organised by the Pak Institute of Peace Studies (PIPS).

Seminar participants connected peace in Pakistan to peace in Afghanistan, and several argued that the new US policy towards China and Pakistan would not be very different from that of the Obama administration.

Hu Shisheng, a scholar from the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICAR), argued that US policy would be more inclined towards India, and referred to US policy towards Pakistan as 'downwards'. He said the US policy toward Afghanistan would be that of 'holding', and the focus would be on the western Pacific region including the South China Sea.

Seminar speakers say US policy toward Pakistan, China may be similar to previous administration's

Mr Hu said US President Donald Trump would focus more on internal affairs than external ones, and may not want to continue with the $23 billion in annual support to Afghanistan.

Mr Hu also spoke about the challenges facing CPEC, and said they revolved around domestic differences in Pakistan. There are 'not only between the civilian and military establishment, but also between parties and different ethnic groups', he said, adding that they did not want to pursue CPEC in a way that enlarged internal differences.

Another speaker, former foreign secretary Inamul Haw, called China's One Belt One Road a strategic initiative that appeared as an alternative to global institutions.

He argued that there are 'some external threats to CPEC that are more worrisome' than internal threats.

He said: 'India wants to isolate Pakistan globally, but CPEC will connect Pakistan with 50 to 60 countries. India will do whatever possible to make CPEC a failure, however, it is satisfactory that other countries would not support India in this regard because of China.'

The seminar also discussed the threat to CPEC from militants, with Regional Peace Institute head Raoof Hassan called the security situation a 'vital variable' towards CPEC's goals. He said a sudden spike of attacks in February has caused concern.

Retired Gen Masood Aslam, who chaired the talk, warned of 'morphing' non-state actors, and said there was news of an Islamic State presence in Afghanistan's eastern provinces.

PIPS head Amir Rana noted that the rise of IS offers an opportunity for regional countries to cooperate.

Humayoun Khan, a scholar, said there should be a joint effort to bring India into regional connectivity projects. He also discussed bureaucratic or institutional delays on Pakistan's end, saying the matter of legally acquiring land for CPEC should have been settled earlier.

Dr Fazlur Rehman, an expert on China, said transparency must be ensured on the projects, and advised feasibility studies that would look at the projects through metrics of 'innovative, sustainable and environmentally-friendly'.

China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project was a game changer for the entire region as it would bring peace, prosperity and political stability to the country, said University of Peshawar Vice-chancellor Prof Mohammad Abid.

Addressing a one-day conference organised by China Studies Cell at UoP here on Wednesday, he said that the project would not only generate thousands of jobs for educated and skilled youth but it would also help in generating thousands of megawatts power.

He said CPEC would help in establishing strong academic linkages between the universities of Pakistan and China, according to a statement.

The conference was also addressed by Prof Zahid Anwar, the coordinator of China Studies Cell; Dr Minhas Majeed Khan; Dr Khalid Khan, additional secretary of higher education department; Prof Noor Mohammad, the vice-chancellor of University of Engineering and Technology Peshawar; Prof Naushad Khan, pro vice-chancellor of Islamia College University; Prof Taj Muharram Khan, dean of social sciences; and Dr Mohammad Muhsin, the director of Institute of Management Sciences Peshawar.

The speakers said that China wanted close relations with Pakistan and by 2025 nearly three-fourth of China's petroleum imports would traverse the Indian Ocean and the piracy-plagued Straits of Malacca.

They said that China was helping Pakistan in turning Gwadar into a transit terminal for African, South American and Middle Eastern oil imports.

They said that China's modernisation strategy required access to abundant supplies of energy.

'This context fully highlights the significance of Gwadar, CPEC and One Belt One Road. It will economically integrate Pakistan,' they added.

The speakers said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was the frontline province in the war against terrorism as its government, citizens and security forces performed duty amid blasts, tears and funerals.

'In this bleak environment CPEC has emerged as a good opportunity. Keeping in view these sufferings, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa deserves to get benefited from the opportunities provided by CPEC,' they added.


 

 

The Afghan graveyard

AFGHANS often proudly refer to their country as 'the graveyard of empires'. Today, unfortunately, it has become just a graveyard. The latest UN Report on Afghanistan chronicles the large and escalating human toll of its prolonged war. Afghanistan has also emerged as the primary source of regional instability.

The major catalysts for the current chaos in Afghanistan were: the 1979 Soviet intervention; the subsequent rise of religious extremism and terrorism; and the two wars fought by the US in Afghanistan - the first to support religious extremists against the Soviet Union and the second against the spawn of these extremists ie Al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban.

After 15 years, the loss of thousands of lives and the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars, the US and its allies have been unable to eliminate Al Qaeda or defeat the Taliban . The unending violence unleashed by the 'war on terror' has, if anything, intensified the terrorist threat from Afghanistan.

US president Obama wanted to cut US losses and leave Afghanistan. He was prevented by his generals from doing so. They could not admit to being stymied by ragtag religious militants. They blamed Pakistani 'safe havens' and duplicity for their failure and pressed Pakistan to fight their fight. This remains the Washington consensus.

The continued presence of the US-Nato forces in Afghanistan serves several unstated goals: to prevent the collapse of the US-installed Kabul regime; to exert pressure on Pakistan and Iran in the context of counter-proliferation and other US regional objectives; to counter the rising influence of Russia and China in Afghanistan and the region.

Most of the TTP and Afghan Taliban have moved to the vast ungoverned areas of Afghanistan.

Pakistan was a willing ally in America's first Afghan war and a reluctant one in the second. The 2001 US invasion pushed many of the Afghan Taliban (as well as Al Qaeda terrorists) into Pakistan. Pakistan's unpopular alliance with the US, and its early military operations in South Waziristan, fed extremism and eventually led to the creation of the so-called Pakistani Taliban (TTP). Pakistan's initial actions in Swat and Fata were mainly against the TTP. But the Zarb-e-Azb operation in North Waziristan enveloped all the militant groups located there, including the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network .

Most of the TTP and Afghan Taliban fighters have now moved to the vast ungoverned areas of Afghanistan. Although the 'good' and 'bad' Taliban distinction has been derided, there is a clear difference between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP. The Afghan Taliban have a feasible political agenda: to secure or share power in Afghanistan. The TTP espouses the nihilistic aim of overthrowing the Pakistani state. The Afghan Taliban do not attack Pakistan; the TTP does - with the sponsorship of Afghan and Indian intelligence. The TTP is now also allied with the militant Islamic State group whereas the Afghan Taliban are fighting it.

IS has announced the extension of its 'caliphate' to the 'Khorasan province' (encompassing Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan and Iran). It has found recruits mainly from the ranks of TTP, Al Qaeda, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and the East Turkmenistan Islamic Movement (ETIM).

The emergence of IS in Afghanistan and its attacks in Pakistan have alarmed Iran, Russia, China and the Central Asian states. They fear that IS will use Afghanistan as a springboard to spread terrorism across the region.

Iran sees IS, with its extremist Sunni ideology, as a mortal enemy which it is fighting in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. As the 'enemy of its enemy', Iran has reportedly extended support to the Afghan Taliban. (Mullah Mansour was killed in Balochistan after visiting Iran).

Moscow has also established contacts with the Afghan Taliban. Russia recently hosted consultations on Afghanistan with Pakistan and China. It was only after protests from Kabul and New Delhi that they were invited to a subsequent meeting in Moscow. The US was not invited to either consultation. Russia is strongly suspicious of the US relationship with IS. Iran has openly accused the US of 'creating' IS.

China is also concerned because ETIM is associated with the TTP and now with IS. Apart from preventing destabilisation of Xinjiang province, China also wants to ensure that the threats emanating from Afghanistan do not disrupt the implementation of President Xi Jinping 's ambitious One-Belt One-Road project, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

India has sought for decades to confront Pakistan with a two-front threat. The 2002 installation of the Northern Alliance-led regime in Kabul revived that possibility. As openly admitted by the Indian national security adviser, Ajit Doval, India is using Afghan territory to destabilise Pakistan by sponsoring TTP terrorism and Baloch insurgents. Despite the visible alliance between the TTP and IS, India will not easily give up its 'assets' in Afghanistan nor reverse its strategy. On the contrary, if the cross-border attacks on Pakistan are stopped, India's former army chief has advocated unleashing unrestrained violence within Pakistan by having 'Pakistanis kill Pakistanis'.

Appeasing Narendra Modi 's India will not avert India's plans for widespread subversion and terrorism in Pakistan. This can be achieved by decisive action against the TTP and the eradication of India's 'sleeper cells' within Pakistan.

The timely ECO summit in Islamabad demonstrated India's failure to isolate Pakistan. The summit's declaration illustrated the growing regional consensus that sustainable regional security requires an end to the Afghan chaos and that IS and its allies, like the TTP, must be opposed and eliminated.

The incoming Trump administration is now the wild card in the endeavour to create durable security in the region. Apart from its hostility towards Iran, the new administration has not pronounced its policies on Afghanistan, Pakistan or the region. Pakistan and other concerned states must seek to convince Washington that, one, peace in Afghanistan can be achieved only through a negotiated settlement between Kabul and the Afghan Taliban; two, IS and its associates, including the TTP, are the primary threat to the security and stability of Afghanistan and the region; and, three, India and its Afghan collaborators must be persuaded to terminate their support to these terrorists.

The current Afghan chaos was created by unilateral military interventions. Ending it needs active international cooperation.


 

 

Mainstreaming Fata

THE Pakhtuns of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ought to be congratulated on the success of their relentless struggle, with the support of the Fata political alliance, to shed the shackles of the draconian Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR). The extension of judicial jurisdiction to Fata and election of representatives to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly in 2018 are welcome steps. The federal government's commitment to rehabilitate and repatriate the displaced Fata Pakhtuns by April 30 should also be appreciated.

At the same time, one can't help but identify some pitfalls in the plan. The first and foremost is introducing the Rewaj Act, which might in many ways be considered synonymous with the colonial FCR. One wonders why a parallel judicial system is required if meaningful mainstreaming is to take place. The entire criminal justice system needs to be revamped - as was pledged in the now 'buried' NAP - instead of a creating parallel apparatus.

The second pitfall is that the merger is to take place in stages. The five-year timeline might either land the plan in a lethargic, bureaucratic pigeonhole, or allow for more resistance by vested interests. Over the past 35 years, two types of interconnected economies have taken hold in Fata. The economy of war was established, which was oiled through the black economy. Sizeable groups in Fata's various agencies, in connivance with some state institutions, have permeated these economies. Hence, the power of the black economy should not be underestimated.

Potential pitfalls in the merger plan remain.

The president might extend judicial jurisdiction to Fata with a single stroke of his pen. A constitutional amendment to Article 247 might be brought in for debate in parliament within weeks. Line departments of KP have already been working in various agencies of Fata. Why take five years when something can be carried out within months?

The rational approach to a KP-Fata merger would be to hand over the implementation plan to the government of KP. Instead of the Fata Development Authority, the relevant KP departments must be given a lead role in implementation. So far, we've seen little to no role of the provincial government in the plan.

It's also strange that the capacity of the Levies is to be enhanced instead of merging Fata's law-enforcement apparatus with the law-enforcement structure of the KP government. Keeping the Levies force intact might develop a parallel law-enforcement apparatus, which may create confusion on jurisdiction. Merging the two will require more resources and, hence, Fata's share in the divisible pool must not be less than four per cent.

Another major pitfall in the current scheme is the establishment of a local government after the 2018 election. Doing so before 2018 would provide a level playing field to all political parties, ensure the participation of and representation for all groups, and enhance the capacity of the provincial election commission for the 2018 polls. Establishing a local government immediately will also ensure the effective implementation of development plans.

For effective, smooth mainstreaming, the inclusion of the youth and women must be considered an essential component of the plan. Public service delivery for both groups must be carried out with diligence and at an enhanced pace. Besides providing a quota for Fata students in provincial and federal educational institutions, the government must quickly ensure qualitative and quantitative improvement of Fata's educational infrastructure.

As far as the development plan for Fata is concerned, it is of utmost importance that infrastructure and institutions be established to enhance indigenous skills for developing products from local resources. Substantial possibilities of exploring minerals and developing agriculture exist, which can lead to large-scale industrialisation.

The idea of connecting Fata with CPEC is admirable, but trade activity and market expansion can only increase when Pakistan and Afghanistan mend fences. Both can benefit if land routes are open on more than a dozen links. It is, therefore, essential for Pakistan to rethink its Afghan policy and let the paradigm of 'strategic depth' die a natural death.

China's One Belt One Road initiative, the Tapi pipeline, initiatives by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the recent declarations at the Economic Cooperation Organisation summit can lead to excellent opportunities for Pakistan's economic growth, prosperity and political stability if Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Iran, China and Russia agree on finding common interests. Instead of using private militias against one another, the states of the region must move towards the paradigm of geo-economics and human security. Here, perhaps, lies the key challenge in effectively mainstreaming Fata.

Legislator asks US to stop treating Pakistan as ally

The head of a United States congressional panel and a former Pentagon official, in a toxic article published on Thursday, urged the Trump administration to stop treating Pakistan as an ally.

In a joint piece they wrote for the National Interest magazine, Congressman Ted Poe and James Clad also referred to a closed-door meeting held for congressional staffers on Tuesday where Ambassador Robert Gallucci, a prominent nuclear weapons expert, urged US policymakers not to wait until Pakistani leaders changed their stance. 'Instead, it's time that the United States sets, unilaterally, the limits of its indulgence,' he argued.

Congressman Poe chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee's subcommittee on terrorism, non-proliferation and trade, while Clad was a deputy assistant secretary of defence for Asia in the George W. Bush administration. The magazine is published by the Centre for the National Interest, a Washington think-tank founded by former president Richard Nixon.

The lawmaker and the former Pentagon official also rejected a suggestion that since Pakistan was a weak state, it needed continued US support.

'Unlike the impression of imminent dissolution (which Islamabad likes to give as an excuse for tolerating domestic extremism), Pakistan in important ways is actually a strong state,' they argued.

They suggested three immediate steps the US administration could take to reset America's relationship with Pakistan: 'Don't let the next crisis in South or Southwest Asia deflect our focus. Don't rush to shore up Pakistan's balance of payments via the IMF or other intermediaries, as we've done in the past. Let China pay that, if the Pakistanis wish to mortgage their future in that way.'

They also claimed that China's 'one belt, one road' infrastructure plans for Pakistan were running into big problems.

Poe and Clad argued that for decades, the US had 'acquiesced in a toxic relationship' with Pakistan, putting up with 'this nominal ally, whose military and security leaders play a lethal double game'.

This dangerous 'game,' according to them 'involves headlong nuclear-weapons production and exporting Islamist terrorism'.

They argued that successive US administrations had failed to find a way out of this, 'playing instead the theatre of 'shared interests' with Islamabad, even when Pakistan's links with insurgents imperilled American lives in Afghanistan while feeding wider instability in Central Asia'.

Quoting recent congressional testimonies and expert analyses, the two claimed that Pakistan had become 'a quasi-adversary,' receiving hundreds of billions of dollars through the years in direct and indirect US support.

They described this relationship as 'a strange hostage-like arrangement in which we pay Islamabad to do what it should be doing anyway to protect its own domestic security and buttress Afghan stability'.

The writers claimed that successive Pakistani military leaders had held the country's governments on a tight leash, 'playing to its various constituencies in Washington very well, especially defence corporations, some residual voices in the intelligence community and parts of the foreign-policy establishment for whom 'maintaining access' in Islamabad edges out realism'.

Each new generation of senior US commanders thought it could 'square the circle,' relying on 'personal links' with Pakistani army corps commanders, they wrote. 'Then some new Sub-continental crisis erupts, and the immediate need to influence Pakistan pushes aside longer-term goals.'

The two claimed that for years, the US looked the other way as Pakistan acquired nuclear-weapons capability, 'going through the kabuki dance of annual non-proliferation certification'.

They noted that lawmakers from both Republican and Democratic parties, in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, tried to attach conditionality to successive aid packages for Pakistan, 'which invariably fail'.

They also provided a brief history of this conditionality, noting that in the weeks after the 9/11 attacks, the US offered a grant of hundreds of millions to Pakistan, on the basis that the money would go towards education reform. 'Our ally used it instead to write down some of its massive foreign debt. And few forget the wink-and-nudge annual certification that Pakistan was not developing nuclear weapons which, of course, it was.'

Giving their arguments for reversing this arrangement, they claimed that over the years, the broad strategic balance had shifted against Pakistan, which failed to invest in human capital.

Poe and Clad acknowledged that changing America's 'reactive accommodating stance' towards Pakistan would not come quickly.

'But it must change irrespective of trends in US-India relations… there's a tendency to think of Pakistan as part of a troubling duality, with India and Pakistan in a death spiral. That's out of date and we have our issues with India too,' they wrote.

'Something must change in our dealings with a terrorist-supporting, irresponsible nuclear-weapons state, and it must change soon. Acquiescing in the current trends is not an option.'

With Pakistan's economy looking poised to hit the annual growth rate of seven per cent, Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) is keen to expand its footprint in the country.

The bank 'is optimistic and excited to actively participate in this turnaround', SCB Group Head Bill Winters said on Thursday in a media roundtable. He was flanked by SCB Regional CEO for Africa and Middle East Sunil Kaushal and bank's Pakistan CEO Shazad Dada.

'I am glad to be here at this juncture when, unlike many other countries, there is positivity in the air. People are talking about investment and discussing projects under CPEC,' he said, referring to scepticism in the West over possible economic options.

'CPEC has opened up new vistas. With the strong brand presence in China and Pakistan, the SCB enjoys natural advantage for a proactive role in CPEC-induced activity,' he said, dismissing fears and reservations expressed regarding the Chinese vision of 'One Belt, One Road'.

Commenting on the issue of lack of transparency in CPEC initiatives, he said, 'Our dealings with our business partners are perfectly transparent and structured. The terms of engagement between countries are beyond our mandate,' he said.

He said the bank's clients around the world, particularly in East Asia, signalled interest in Pakistan. 'It might take some time, but foreign investors will enter Pakistan as the country embarks on journey to the future.'

Comparing the bank's experience of dealing with Pakistani businessmen with others in the region, Mr Kaushal said they 'are relatively domestic'.

'The quality of business class is a function of the size of an economy and scale of business,' he said.


 

 

Trade and geopolitics of Indian Ocean discussed

To discuss the parameters, or lack thereof, of oceanic and territorial routes and the crossover of people, ideas and goods across the interconnected terrain of Eurasia and the Indian Ocean, the Habib University on Friday hosted a talk by Prof Edward Simpson, professor of social anthropology at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.

Prof Simpson was of the opinion that 'if you think of how many borders, boundaries, linguistic spheres, islands, territorial conglomerations, superpowers, visible and invisible powers, are at work in the Indian Ocean, then you truly have an arena in which all boundaries and citizenship are being played out with an intensity that could never have been played out in any previous time in history.'

The two-day conference, 'Order Beyond Borders: Sovereignty and Citizenship in Asia and the Indian Ocean World', is an attempt to highlight the various political transitions and transformations around the world and tie them in with the increased infrastructural investment such as through 'emerging developments in Asia such as China's One Belt, One Road (Obor) project, Turkey's neo-Ottomanism, Russia's Eurasian Economic Union.'

Prof Simpson explained how on the southern shores of the Gulf of Kachchh to this day, similar to Karachi, huge wooden boats are being built. 'They look like arcs and people often see them and say that these must be part of an ancient tradition. However, I don't think there is anything old or anything traditional about these.'

He recalled the time when he started his fieldwork in the late 1990s, and recounted meeting a seafarer on the shores and asking him about where he traded. Eventually their conversations led him to uncover how at the time seafarers were bypassing the trade embargo imposed by the United Nations on Iraq.

'The vessels that were built in Gujarat were trading with smaller ports in Iraq. They would say they were taking medicines, tyres, humanitarian things but you can twist that in different ways. A decade later, the entire geography of the Indian Ocean trade from Gujarat has changed. They were no longer going to Iraq, they were headed to Somalia. They went to Dubai, picked up second-hand cars, took them to Somalia and from there they came back with material such as charcoal and animals.'

A few years later Prof Simpson found out that the seafarers were headed to Yemen. 'Yet another state that has been encouraged to fail, another state which has had its infrastructure removed by different kinds of international sanctions and pressures, and these guys saw an opportunity and their trade was invigorated again.'

Prof Simpson also spoke at length about Réunion island, a region of France in the Indian Ocean, where he said progress was 'incremental as the roads get bigger and bigger. The island is a playground for engineers in a way that it was a place where they could play and experiment.'

To give evidence of this, he showed a short video of how several attempts were made to connect the main city with the port, and how most of these experiments that constituted making a functional road network failed and are still being worked on. 'A lot of the work being done there couldn't have been done in France.'

A question from the audience inquired whether road network construction approvals, especially in a postcolonial context, are about the idea of expanding state frontiers to reach out to those areas which are outside state control, as in the case of Balochistan.

Prof Simpson agreed with the thought expressed, and said that road infrastructures are also about 'state formations, about visibility, about describing a certain tendency of modernity.'

Prof Simpson's first book, Muslim Society and the Western Indian Ocean: The Seafarers of Kachchh, is considered to be a significant text on the Indian Ocean. His current work in progress is on knowledge practices, interrelations and motivations of road builders in South Asia.


 

 

An opportunity

PAKISTAN'S leaders often boast of our vital strategic geographical location. Yet this location has done little more than thrust the country into global wars and force it to become a proxy battleground for foreign ideological agendas. Pakistan now has an opportunity to turn this reality around courtesy of the profound geopolitical changes facing the world today.

There is increasing talk of a shift from America's global hegemony to multipolarity and of a new emerging Great Game in which Washington is being challenged by aspiring competitors. Smaller states seldom have a chance to influence the direction of such hegemonic competition. But Pakistan finds itself suitably placed to force the great powers to be more cooperative and extract benefits for itself.

Geography is the principal enabler. Competition is most pronounced in the South China Sea, in Russia's extended backyard, and in the Middle East. Each of these regions intersects with Pakistan's neighbourhood, and herein lies the opportunity.

China's 'Belt and Road' initiative is the poster child for Beijing's willingness to prove its global mettle. CPEC is the quintessential test case whose success is necessary to convince China's aspiring allies of its ability to lead independent geostrategic initiatives of serious consequence. This implies that Pakistan will be centre stage in Chinese foreign policy.

Pakistan can work the global chessboard in its favour.

Second, Russia is looking for new partners and markets to export arms. India's tilt towards the US has provided Pakistan an opening to mend ties with Moscow.

Third, because of the Middle East chaos, the world is struggling to find geopolitically relevant Muslim country partners that can have a moderating influence in the Islamic world. Pakistan is an obvious candidate.

Finally, the presence of nuclear weapons on the subcontinent implies that the costs of a total blow-up of Pak-India ties or Pakistan's implosion are prohibitive.

With some visionary thinking, Pakistan can work the global chessboard in its favour by bringing the US, China, Russia, among others, together on these issues. China will remain CPEC's driving force but proactive outreach from Pakistan to identify options to involve the US, UK, and Russia more seriously could transform an initiative otherwise seen as one of the flagships of Sino-US competition in Asia into a cooperative one.

Likewise, the US, China, and Russia share concerns about Islamist extremism. Pakistan is seen as part of the problem but its recent domestic counterterrorism successes imply that it can present itself as a potentially stable Muslim country that can stand up to the onslaught of Salafi-inspired radicalism that is beginning to face pushback in Pakistan. The fact that Islamabad maintains deep ties with the Gulf/Middle East positions it well to play this role.

Further, the world's shared interest in avoiding a Pak-India disaster implies the need for the great powers to keep Pakistan engaged. This militates against the Modi government's self-stated policy to isolate Pakistan and leaves space open for continued relations between Pakistan and the great powers, even if India remains their preferred partner. This will require Pakistan to reconsider its foreign policy orientation in at least two respects.

Foremost, the Cold War mentality of putting all eggs in one basket still lingers in Pakistani thinking. The emerging global order will prize countries able to demonstrate their importance for all competing camps. The current discourse in Pakistan about Sino-Pak relations and improved Pak-Russia ties offsetting the deteriorating Pak-US equation is self-defeating in this regard. The US remains Pakistan's largest export partner, it holds most influence over international donors that Pakistan relies on, and only it has the military, economic, and diplomatic tools to isolate Pakistan. No good can come of being on America's wrong side.

Second, Pakistan's role as a melting pot for great power cooperation requires a better-managed neighbourhood. The tendency to allow ties with India to drive the country's global policy orientation and the nature of its ties with other important countries has hurt Pakistan. The smarter policy would be to isolate Pak-India problems from broader discussions about Pakistan's relations with the great powers. Refusal of other countries to support Islamabad on Pak-India issues must not be allowed to overshadow the need to work with them to establish Pakistan's utility as a key enabler of great power cooperation in and around the South Asian region.

Finally, the vision purported here is predicated on Pakistan's internal strength. Economic and governance reforms that create opportunities for inclusive growth and stability remain crucial. So does the need for the state to consolidate counterterrorism gains and push ahead with the agenda to reverse the growing extremism in society. This implies the need to ensure zero tolerance for all terrorist outfits in the country.


 

 

Double happiness

THE China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project is a win-win proposition for both countries. It can create 'Double Happiness' (Chairman Mao's favourite cigarette brand).

For Pakistan, CPEC promises the installation of the basic infrastructure essential for rapid growth. It would replicate a development model that enabled China to achieve double-digit growth for almost four decades.

CPEC is also important for China. It is the first stage of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative designed to establish closer land and maritime links with 65 Eurasian countries. CPEC will help stabilise 'Iron Brother' Pakistan economically, counter terrorism, provide China an alternative, shorter route to markets and energy sources in the Gulf, west Asia and beyond, and enable the efficient utilisation of some of China's financial reserves and excess manufacturing capacity.

Western criticism of the CPEC project smacks of sour grapes. Yet Pakistanis would do well to not be misled by motivated critiques.

Pakistanis would do well to not be misled by motivated critiques.

Prior to the CPEC launch, foreign investment in Pakistan was virtually frozen. The CPEC commitment and financial flows have helped accelerate Pakistan's GDP growth rate from 3.7 to around five per cent; its stock market is the best-performing in Asia; it has been reclassified as an emerging rather than frontier market; and Western companies are now open to investing here.

All commercial enterprises seek to earn a profit. Chinese companies also operate on market principles. China's authorities have allowed their companies to compete for various projects and thus enabled Pakistani counterparts, if they wish, to negotiate Chinese participation (in equipment supply and construction) at the best market prices. If monopoly control and price gouging have occurred, for example, in some power projects, it has mostly been due to the collusion of Pakistani entities and, in some cases, of Western equipment suppliers.

Pakistan's infrastructure cannot be built without capital imports. Chinese loans for government projects are provided on concessional terms. The proportional burden for their repayment will decline as Pakistan's economy grows. For commercial projects, Chinese partners arrange loans at around 5 to 6pc with extended repayment periods. These terms are unavailable elsewhere. (Pakistan has floated sovereign bonds in Western markets at 8pc.) Increasingly, Chinese companies are also willing to put equity into commercial projects and thus assume a part of the risk. Commercial loans are expected to be paid back from anticipated profits. A part of the debt is likely to be off-loaded through share sales in public markets.

The UN-sponsored World Happiness Report 2017 ranks China at 79, Pakistan at 80 and India 122 among 155 countries. A Forbes magazine analysis attributed the Pakistani population's significantly higher 'happiness' than India's to two factors: greater economic freedom and larger government expenditures. Such expenditures have been made possible mostly by the CPEC project.

Pakistani 'happiness' can be further enhanced if the country can efficiently execute the CPEC infrastructure projects and extend these investments to social infrastructure and the real economy. So far, despite glitches, CPEC implementation is proceeding well. But Pakistan must address three major issues.

First, there is the provision of adequate security for CPEC projects, threatened as they are by Indian-sponsored terrorism and sabotage. India has reportedly told China that it will never accept CPEC.

Second, equitable allocation of CPEC projects and investment to the smaller provinces is essential to ensure national support. Hopefully, CPEC will not be allowed to become an issue in the forthcoming national elections.

Third, there is a need for policy consistency. Sudden changes in some policies - no new power plants based on imported fuel, shifts in power tariffs, tax incentives and rates - are evidently the consequence of tensions between some of Pakistan's power players. Such arbitrary policy shifts create uncertainty.

Beyond the current CPEC projects, there is need for an increasing focus on social infrastructure: clean drinking water, healthcare, waste management, urban transportation and education. Many Chinese companies are keen to participate in such projects, which can best be implemented through public-private partnerships with the federal, provincial and local governments.

The real fruit of the CPEC enterprise will come from investments in the sectors that are the real generators of production, employment and growth: industrial manufacturing, agriculture and agro-industries, consumer goods, and housing and related supply chains and services, including their digital component. Such investment promises high returns. Here too, Chinese companies are prepared to invest significant amounts in viable ventures.

To encourage such investment, it is essential to actively promote more frequent and intensive exchanges between Pakistani and Chinese economic actors and companies, especially the smaller companies that are totally unfamiliar with each other. Sporadic efforts have been made, yet no organised mechanism is available.

Investments in infrastructure and the growth sectors in Pakistan are constrained by the paucity of local finance. The government is poor because of inadequate and inefficient tax collection and wasteful expenditures on loss-making state corporations and populist subsidies. Bold policy action is essential. In the private sector, apart from a few family conglomerates, Pakistani enterprises do not possess the capacity to put up the initial equity even for sound projects. Most cannot finance the preparation of bankable feasibility studies. Yet, it is these smaller enterprises that can generate the most jobs. Local banks and financial institutions, including the dormant China-Pakistan Development Company, should be incentivised to provide start-up finance to smaller enterprises. Locally and externally generated Private Equity Funds can also play a vital role in bridging the domestic financial shortfall.

Finally, to take full advantage of domestic demand-led growth, Pakistan must formulate a long-term Pakistan-First trade and industrial policy. Most of Pakistan's Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) have been concluded on the presumption that it can expand exports if it has trade access. Yet, history proves that unless a country has the capacity to produce goods, it cannot export them even if it has access. To build domestic manufacturing capacity, Pakistan must selectively discourage imports of goods it can produce. Once competitive, such products can add to exports. To implement this policy, Pakistan's FTAs and World Trade Organisation tariff schedules and commitments must be comprehensively revised, and the illegal smuggling of dumped goods from Afghanistan and elsewhere effectively halted.

The road to double happiness is clear and visible. Pakistan and China must not be diverted.


 

 

NON-FICTION: The lost comrades

Unveiled in 2013, China's One Belt, One Road initiative - of which the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a part - promises to integrate Afro-Eurasia through a web of new infrastructure, the development of manufacturing nodes and emerging markets. Connectivity is the hallmark of an increasingly global China that engages the world through trade and finance, global governance and diplomacy.

Those with an inclination towards history will, however, appreciate that China's global engagement has deep historical roots: the Middle Kingdom's vast archives reveal a textured illustration of China's extensive foreign engagement over thousands of years. Conversely, there have also been moments when powerful internal events came to define an era, such as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) that was launched by Mao Zedong in the last decade of his life. Guobin Yang's The Red Guard Generation and Political Activism in China tackles this mass campaign that transpired just over 50 years ago. Thoughtful, original and erudite, The Red Guard Generation makes important contributions to our study of the Cultural Revolution in particular, and more broadly, to Sinology.

Even after half a century, the Cultural Revolution remains a complex event to parse. From a distance - and for those uninitiated in Chinese history - it may appear as one of the many global student movements of the 1960s when youth mobilisation challenged the status quo in scores of countries. A circumscribed look quickly reveals the limitations of such a perspective: the mass campaign, especially in its early stages, both reflected a factional struggle within the Chinese Communist Party, and an attempt by Mao to instill revolutionary fervour in a youthful demographic that had not been exposed to revolutionary struggle. Less an account of factional politics, Yang contributes to our understanding of the latter process.

A thoughtful look at Mao's attempt to instill revolutionary fervour in a youthful demographic

Following the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, the youth was simultaneously projected as the 'flowers of the nation,' and equally importantly, as Yang notes, the 'revolutionary successors.' Prior to the Cultural Revolution, this generation was coming of age against the backdrop of revolutionary imagery and rhetoric: class struggle, martyrdom and heroism that was being juxtaposed against the backdrop of the Cold War of Asia, in which China faced off the threat, initially of the United States, and in the 1960s that of the US and the Soviet Union.

Within weeks of its launch, the Cultural Revolution had mobilised millions of youth who became foot soldiers in this new revolutionary schema. Young people now banded together in revolutionary 'Red Guard' factions. But this was no typical student mobilisation: Red Guard factions violently turned on each other, universities remained shut for years and vigilantes mercilessly targeted those segments of the urban population that were seen to be associated with the Four Olds: old customs, old culture, old habits, old ideas. The Red Guard Generation tells the story of China's urban youth who were mobilised during the Cultural Revolution. Yang asks: Why did the Red Guards splinter into factions? What became of them in the 1970s? How did the now-former Red Guards deal with the economic and political transitions that began under Deng Xiaoping after 1978? Fifty years later, what is the role of memory in how tumultuous events from a different time are remembered?

One striking aspect of the Cultural Revolution is the memorabilia it produced, that served as new media: posters, pins, and above all, the ubiquitous Little Red Book of Quotations by Mao. These powerful objects made the revolution come alive. The Red Guard Generation illustrates how these permeated society, constituting what Yang describes as a 'revolutionary script' that was widely accessible. 'These young rebels were performing in a revolutionary drama, often in imitation of roles in the sacred script of the Chinese revolution,' he writes. 'There was a unity of performance and reality.' Here, Yang describes a letter from a student of Chongqing University in which the student evoked suffering under the 'old society' prior to 1949, where his mother had to beg for food; that suffering was now projected on to the present. 'We must exert ourselves, struggle hard, and not fear death,' the student - who subsequently lost his life - had written. As Yang thoughtfully observes, the student was 'following a script […] learned through socialisation and education. […] His role was his reality.' But ironically, as Yang illustrates, if popular mobilisation - and, as an extension, factional fighting - was a consequence of a popular culture deeply imbued with revolutionary symbolism, so too was revolutionary theory, an extension of which were manifestations of dissent.

Although the Cultural Revolution would continue - until 1969 or 1976 depending on classification - the Red Guards were disbanded in mid-1968, two years after they had first come together. The Red Guards who had mobilised for the Revolution were eventually demobilised by Mao himself. Following demobilisation, 17 million Red Guards were rusticated, that is, 'sent down' to work in the countryside. While the initial wave of sent-down youth left voluntarily (in the fall of 1967) to take revolutionary ideals to the countryside, by late 1968 and into early 1969, the state had to resort to a combination of cajoling and coercion. For many now-former Red Guards, being forced to move from cities to the countryside was both a 'fall from heaven,' and their first exposure to labour in China's resource-strapped rural areas. It forced them to confront the revolutionary rhetoric that had been branded during Red Guard factional fighting, the poverty of the Chinese countryside and the limited resources available to the Chinese peasant. Rustication, however, proved to be more than a temporary jaunt to a farm. As the 1970s wore on, and even following the death of Mao in 1976, sent-down youth remained in the countryside. Although some discreetly made their way back to their home cities, millions remained in the rural areas until the end of the decade, their frustration evidenced by frequent protests.

In other ways, too, the story of the Red Guards continued beyond the end of their initial political mobilisation. Yang provides rich accounts of new forms of cultural expression as many former Red Guards took to letter-writing, note-taking, singing, reading and poetry to articulate new ideas about self and society. The ascendency of Deng, who himself had been twice purged, opened space for those who had suffered during the Cultural Revolution to begin telling their stories. Into the 1990s and, according to Yang, up until the present the legacies of the Cultural Revolution - and those who participated in this revolution within the Revolution - continue to echo in nostalgia, memory and personal networks.

The Red Guard Generation is an ambitious book that makes a novel contribution to the growing scholarship on China's Cultural Revolution. Writing about events that have fractured society is always difficult; The Red Guard Generation is an example of how such histories can be approached thoughtfully and creatively. For me, the book is also an illustration of how much the field has grown over the last 20 years, a point in time when I had read widely around the Cultural Revolution. Although those with a background in Chinese history will be able to engage more deeply with Yang's framing and his contribution to the field, others shall appreciate the clarity and elegance with which he tells this most difficult of stories.

Rising dragon, wounded eagle

WHEN China's former vice premier, Qian Qichen, was asked 20 years ago about the future of Sino-US relations, he reportedly responded: 'They [Sino-US relations] will never be as good as they should be; and never be as bad as they can be.' This prognosis holds true today for the world's 'most important bilateral relationship'.

The largest and second-largest economies are now deeply intertwined and interdependent through trade, supply chains and finance. But the fortunes of the Chinese dragon have been rising; the power of the American eagle has been dented by long wars and economic profligacy. The Greek historian, Thucydides, postulated that when an established power faces a rising one, a clash is almost inevitable.

In its final years, the Obama administration seemed to be rushing towards the Thucydides Trap. Obama's 'pivot to Asia' consisted of: an effort to build a string of US alliances around China's periphery - from Japan to India; the deployment of two-thirds of US naval power to the Pacific; a challenge to China's maritime claims in the South China Sea; and China's exclusion from the Trans Pacific (trade) Partnership.

Prospects for Sino-US relations worsened with Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric against China and threats to slap punitive tariffs on its exports and declare it a 'currency manipulator'. In justifying his unprecedented call with Taiwan's leader, Trump threatened to discard the One China policy unless China agreed to trade concessions. Tensions were further heightened when the incoming US secretary of state asserted that the US could deny China access to its claims in the South China Sea.

The fortunes of the Chinese dragon have been rising; the power of the American eagle has been dented.

Since then, the Trump administration has walked back, slowly, from its most extreme positions. US Defence Secretary Mattis assured that the South China Sea disputes would have to be resolved through negotiations. In a carefully choreographed call with the Chinese president, Trump affirmed continued US adherence to the One China policy.

The recent Trump-Xi summit in Mar-a-Lago was expected to determine the direction of US-China relations. Although the summit was overshadowed by the US missile strikes against Syria, there was no acrimony, and agreement was reached on a high-level security dialogue and a 100-day plan to address trade.

However, uncertainty persists due to Trump's unpredictability. He will not declare China a 'currency manipulator'. But Trump has now linked the trade talks to China's help on North Korea.

In his tweets, President Trump has repeatedly urged China to resolve the threat from North Korea 'or the US will'. The US deployment of a US carrier group towards the Korean Peninsula has escalated tensions. But the US is unlikely to conduct a pre-emptive or punitive strike against North Korea (à la Syria) given Pyongyang's capacity for a devastating response. And, the 'window' for such a strike is likely to close shortly if, as expected, the left-wing candidate wins the South Korean presidency and rules out the use of force.

China shares the US aim of denuclearising North Korea, and is deeply angered by Kim Jong-un's provocative nuclear and missile tests and indifference to China's wider interests. China is likely to support intensified Security Council sanctions against North Korea, including an embargo on oil sales, if it continues its tests. Yet, China is unlikely to intensify pressure to the extent of triggering the collapse of the North Korean economy or the Pyongyang regime. This could lead to war, massive refugee flows into China and possible absorption of North Korea by the South, bringing US troops to China's border.

Under the circumstances, the best option may be a resumption of the five plus one (US, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea plus North Korea) dialogue; a de facto 'acceptance' of North Korea's nuclear capabilities; and a freeze on its nuclear and missile development in exchange for economic aid and assurances of regime survival. Even this outcome will be difficult to negotiate.

Given the Korean crisis, it is fortunate that, at least so far, the US has not revived the provocative challenge to China in the South China Sea. Absent US intervention, China will probably display flexibility and offer economic cooperation to its Southeast Asian neighbours to resolve maritime disputes. The peaceful resolution of the South China Sea disputes would remove a major source of potential Sino-US friction and confrontation.

Apart from Korea, trade is the other headline issue for Trump in dealing with China. For its part, Beijing wants a more balanced trade relationship with the US, and a reduction of the $300 billion bilateral trade surplus, through trade expansion rather than restriction. To this end, it appears willing to facilitate US agricultural, services and other exports and to stimulate domestic demand in China. But it will also urge the US to lift the wide-ranging restrictions on the sale of advanced technological goods and services to China as one way of correcting the trade imbalance.

Xi's economic trump card may be an offer of Chinese participation in Trump's plan to restore and modernise America's aging infrastructure. China has the finance, expertise and recent experience to make a significant contribution. If Trump's plans for tax breaks are stalled, he may welcome China's contribution.

Such cooperation on infrastructure may open the door to US participation in China's path-breaking One Belt, One Road initiative which its media has dubbed as 'Globalisation 2.0'. China has invited US participation in the project. It could be extremely lucrative for US corporations and industry.

A first step in this direction may be active US participation in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor endeavour. The Asian Development Bank and the World Bank are already financing some CPEC-related projects in Pakistan. American companies are also involved as equipment suppliers for power plants and financial, technical and legal consultants in various projects.

Ever since it arranged Henry Kissinger's clandestine trip to China in 1971, Pakistan has had a significant stake in the preservation of positive Sino-US relations. Today, if a great power consensus can be achieved on a strategy for stability in Afghanistan and counterterrorism, Pakistan can become the geographical locus for economic and strategic cooperation between the world's two primary powers.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Monday signed 11 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with Chinese companies for development projects in the province under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

According to a press release, MoUs were signed for five projects costing up to Rs60 billion. These projects are related to CPEC Tower, construction of a new bus terminal at Chamkani, Ring Road missing link, Health City at Regi Model Town, and Commercial and Residential Reconstruction Centre.

Local Government Secretary Jamal Shah signed the MoUs on behalf of the KP government. Chief Minister Pervez Khattak, Minister for Local Government Inayatullah and Peshawar Development Authority (PDA) Director General Salim Watto were also present on the occasion.

These projects will be jointly executed by PDA and Chinese companies, the press release said.

The construction of the Ring Road missing link will cost up to Rs12bn while that of the new general bus stand at Chamkani will cost Rs10bn. The construction of CPEC Tower will be carried out at Rs5bn while that of Health City at Regi Model Township is estimated to cost up to Rs22bn.

The initial estimate for the construction cost of Commercial and Residential Reconstruction Centre is around Rs11bn.

PC-1s of these projects are complete, it said. The Chinese authorities will soon visit Pakistan to finalise the execution process, said Mr Watto.

Other development projects are related to information technology, special economic zones, power plants, oil refinery, infrastructure and e-commerce.

Speaking at the MoU signing ceremony, Mr Khattak invited Chinese companies to take advantage of the investment-friendly environment in KP.

'We have set the stage to begin the journey of industrialisation in the province. We need the support of our iron brothers to put the province on the path of development and economic growth,' he said.

Appreciating the One Belt, One Road Initiative, he said the CPEC is its flagship component and stressed that business, cultural and social cooperation between Pakistan and China should be further enhanced.

Mr Khattak said a strong security force comprising 4,500 personnel has been established for the protection of foreign workforce, including Chinese nationals.

While emphasising the importance of the CPEC, China-Pakistan Friendship Association President Sha Zhu Kang said the success of One Belt, One Road initiative is linked with the CPEC, which he termed the pilot project of the grand scheme.

He said the proposed corridor stretching from Kashgar to Gwadar will bring about economic and social progress.

He said Chinese companies are already working in KP and providing job opportunities to a large number of locals.

Ambassador Khalid said that around 86 projects, including those in energy, agriculture and infrastructure sectors, will be presented for investment and cooperation. He said the KP chief minister's visit to China, second in the last four months, underscores the importance of the CPEC and Sino-Pak relations.

The ambassador said all political parties in Pakistan are on the same page as far as Sino-Pak relations are concerned.

He said the CPEC is showing steady progress. Now the Gwadar port is operational and energy and infrastructure projects are being completed in time, he added.

Discussing benefits of the China-Pakistan Econo­mic Corridor (CPEC), speakers on Thursday, the concluding day of a three-day conference, said the corridor would equally benefit Pakistan and China, which would develop their undeveloped provinces of Balochistan and Xinjiang respectively.

Addressing the concluding session of the international conference on the 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: Political, Economic and Social Perspectives' organised by the Sindh University (SU), they observed that this project would not only lead to prosperity, but also strengthen the economic ties between the two nations.

Addressing the session, Vice Chan­cellor Prof Dr Fateh Moham­mad Burfat said the conference remained successful and it had achieved its objectives as was evident from research and valuable inputs of scholars. He said the SU was focusing on CPEC and producing skilled graduates to accommodate them in the related projects.

'If academic environment in varsities is enabling, it will bring about a change in the attitude of students and take them to the heights of academic and research activities,' he said. He said federal minister for planning and development Ahsan Iqbal on the first day of the conference had promised that he would get mega projects for Sindh University's development and progress.

Earlier, presenting his research, Dr Shabbir Ahmed Khan of the Area Study Centre, Peshawar University, said CPEC was an important component of China's version of One Belt One Road (Obor) initiative aimed at filling infrastructure gap across Asia through roads' network, highways, rail links, energy pipelines and seaports by spending around $600 billion to link Asia, Africa and other European countries. He said that Chinese aim was access to Europe by the land route as well as maritime routes.

'China believes relations with emerging powers are important,' he said and added that Obor would eventually provide China with overland and maritime access to Europe.

He said: 'CPEC would benefit both countries because China and Pakistan intend to develop their underdeveloped areas of Balochistan and Xinjiang.'

Another scholar, Mariyam Sid­dique, said CPEC would bring peace and prosperity and mark an era of affluence as both countries would strengthen economic ties.

'After 2008 financial crises, China had a chance to rebalance its economy and made a shift in economic strategy to move towards 'new normal' to transform economy for suitable growth,' she maintained. She said CPEC would be a beneficial tool of China for practical implementation of its dream.

Others who spoke on the occasion were Dr Ravichandran Moo­rthy, Ross Masood Hussain, Dr Mus­sarat Jabeen, Dr Ngeow Chow Bing, Dr Chih-yu Shih, Dr Zhao Zhi­hui and Dr Hamadullah Kakepoto.

Later, the VC gave away shields to scholars and conference's organising committee members.

A team of adventurers, writers, photographers, documentary makers and historians is set to go on a 30-day, 10,600km journey of rediscovering the historic Silk Route.

They will depart from Shanghai, where they have gathered to finalise preparations for their expedition.

Team leader Khwaja (KM) Ali said they would explore transformation of Silk Road from what it is today to what is planned for tomorrow.

The expedition will follow the silk worms rearing and production in areas around Suzhou near Shanghai then join the main Silk Road at Xi'an to Dunhuang and Kashgar.

The team will explore and travel along the Taklamakan Desert, Tian Shan mountains, Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalaya ranges into the less travelled and written southern arm of the trade route to South Asia where it terminates at Multan before branching out.

A distance of over 10,000km will be covered in the month-long journey from Shanghai to Gwadar

The team will also explore the evolution of the New Silk Road on the Karakoram Highway (KKH) down to the port city of Gwadar.

The growth of Silk Road from the period of camel caravans to the motorised highways of the future will be travelled and documented. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the One Belt-One Road has been planned to improve travel, trade and economics of the area. The current activity of construction of roads and conditions of facilities will also be recorded.

Mr Ali will be accompanied by Sabiha Omar, Dr Imran Chaudhry, Dr Nasim Chaudhry, Babar Ali, Mahera Omar, Yasmin Ali, Dr Sayed Amjad Hussain and Lubna Khan. They will be joined in Pakistan by Syed Azam Jaffer and Mohammed Farrukh Khan.

Many of the members have participated in earlier expeditions like the Indus River Expedition (1978), Swat White Water (1981), Ravi-Indus-Chenab Expedition 1984, Team Indus 1985 from the source of the Indus in Tibet, China and Fraser River Kayaking (2016).

Some are active members of OffRoad-Pakistan wilderness explorers. The team plans to write about their adventures to encourage trade, travel and use of this historic trade route which has seen massive exchange of goods, ideas, cultures and religions across continents.

The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will help Pakistan improve its infrastructure and regional connectivity, said Stephen P Knode, commercial officer from the US Commercial Service on Tuesday.

Mr Knode was visiting the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) where he met with the local business community.

He said the US was committed to improving trade and investment ties with Pakistan and that both countries have good potential for establishing business partnerships.

He invited the business community to attend the Select USA investment summit to be held June 18 through to June 20, 2017.

'More than 45 states are participating in the summit and there are great opportunities for small and medium size companies,' he said.

'I have seen a lot of positive things and I will encourage US companies to take benefit of prospective opportunities in Pakistan,' he said.

The commercial officer appreciated the RCCI's role in promoting business activities and trade relations by holding exhibitions inside and outside the country.

RCCI President Raja Amer Iqbal said the bilateral trade between Pakistan and the US was less than the potential of both countries and that both Pakistan and the US should focus on the exchange of trade delegations to improve two-way trade.

'Business to business meetings are very important for understanding each other's requirements. The US should promote trade with Pakistan which is the best way to strengthen Pakistan's economy,' he said.

The $51 billion CPEC project is part of the $1,465 billion One Belt One Road project, he said. Pakistan's economic outlook offers a promising future, he said and said more US investors should explore Pakistan for joint ventures and investment in energy, pharmaceuticals, infrastructure development and other sectors.

'The business community thinks CPEC should not be centred on a specific country and it offers great regional connectivity and integration from South Asia, Central Asian countries and beyond,' he said.

The commercial officer was briefed on RCCI's current and future programmes.


 

 

Stuck in the Afghan muck

ACCORDING to legend, Alexander the Great's mother sent him a letter taunting him for being stuck in Afghanistan for three years after conquering Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Persia in a year. Alexander sent her back some Afghan earth to spread in her courtyard. Having tread on this, Macedonia's nobles began to bicker and fight amongst themselves.

America's generals have now been stuck in Afghanistan for 15 years. Unlike Alexander, they blame their failure not on the divisive realities of Afghanistan but on exogenous factors: alleged support to the Afghan Taliban from Pakistan and, more recently, from Russia and Iran. Alexander ultimately pacified Afghanistan by marrying the daughter of the insurgent leader and recruiting him to his cause. Today too - though a marriage between America and the Afghan Taliban is unlikely - ending the Afghan insurgency requires a bold political solution.

Instead, the US commander in Afghanistan has asked for more troops to fight the Taliban as well as the militant Islamic State (IS) group. It is unclear how 15,000 US-Nato troops can achieve what 180,000 failed to accomplish in over a decade. The US insistence in seeking a military solution in Afghanistan is either the consequence of injured pride and strategic confusion or part of a wider regional strategy. It may be a combination of both.

The Moscow consultations, or a UN process, should promote a viable peace plan for Afghanistan.

America's military presence in Afghanistan serves to prop up the regime it has installed in Kabul and provide a base to coerce Afghanistan's neighbours and conduct drone strikes and special operations à la Abbottabad if and when needed. It also curtails the influence of Russia and China in this strategically located country.

The US military has probably concluded, correctly, that the demoralised Afghan National Army will be unable to defeat the Afghan Taliban and the best hope of arresting the Taliban's momentum is to cajole or coerce Pakistan to join the fight against them, especially against the Haqqani network, which is reputedly the most effective element of the Afghan insurgency.

Pakistan's Zarb-e-Azb operation destroyed the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Haqqani infrastructure in North Waziristan and forced all the groups there to relocate to Afghanistan's ungoverned areas. The Pakistan Army has gone to great lengths to show American generals and politicians that the Haqqanis do not have 'safe havens' in Pakistan. Pakistan's new ambassador in Washington has declared that the Haqqanis are not Pakistan's 'friends' or 'proxies'. But neither are the Haqqanis attacking Pakistan, unlike TTP which is now based in Afghanistan and reportedly enjoys the support of Afghan and Indian intelligence. Pakistan's priority remains to eliminate TTP and IS.

Despite Pakistan's desire to establish a constructive relationship with the Trump administration, it appears that the US establishment remains stuck in the Obama-era paradigm of viewing Pakistan through the Afghan (and Indian) prism. The new US national security adviser's recent statement in Kabul regarding Pakistani 'safe havens' caused considerable consternation in Pakistan. H.R. McMaster's meetings in Islamabad and Rawalpindi were 'testy' by all accounts. His 'talking points' were probably prepared in the White House by Lisa Curtis, who co-chaired (with Hussain Haqqani) a recent think tank report calling for the US to declare Pakistan a 'state sponsor of terrorism' unless it ended alleged support to terrorist groups like the Haqqanis, the Laskhkar-e-Taiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammad.

However, today, Pakistan is less susceptible to US pressure than in the past. For one thing, the US 'incentives' to the Pakistani military - Coalition Support Funds and foreign military support funds - have been suspended and are unlikely to be revived even if Pakistan accepts the US demands. Second, pressure on Pakistan could prove counterproductive if its current cooperation with the US on Afghanistan and counterterrorism is terminated. Third, the Trump administration has revived tensions with Iran and will find it difficult to confront both Iran and Pakistan at the same time. It is also preoccupied with the North Korean crisis and multiple domestic scandals and squabbles.

Most importantly, Russia and China have come to accept Pakistan's view that the Afghan Taliban's objectives are limited to their country and the insurgency can be ended only through negotiations. There is also an emerging realisation that the Afghan Taliban are potential allies in fighting IS (which is linked to TTP and Jamaatul Ahrar).Moscow has initiated consultations to build a regional consensus on Afghanistan and counterterrorism on the basis of these assumptions.

It is essential that these consultations lead to the formulation of the parameters of a political settlement in Afghanistan. The farce of an 'Afghan-led, Afghan-owned' process must be discarded. The peace terms proposed by the US and Kabul: 'reconciliation' by the Afghan Taliban with Kabul and acceptance of the US-formulated Afghan constitution, without promising the total withdrawal of foreign forces, are obviously unacceptable to the Taliban. On the other hand, the Taliban too have displayed little flexibility, refusing direct talks with Kabul until all foreign forces have left Afghanistan.

The Moscow consultations, or a UN process, should step in to promote a viable peace plan for Afghanistan. This could include: mutual cessation of hostilities; a recognition of the 'control' of specific areas of Afghanistan by Kabul or the Taliban; a plan for cooperative action by Kabul and the Taliban and Afghanistan's neighbours to combat IS and other terrorist groups; commitment to formulate a new or revised constitution which provides for power-sharing between Kabul, the Taliban and other Afghan 'stakeholders', and an agreement on a timetable for the staged withdrawal of foreign forces in tandem with the implementation of agreed political milestones.

Even if the US is initially unwilling to participate in formulating such a peace plan, other parties should commence the process through available forums and mechanisms. Eventually, once it becomes clear that a military solution is unavailable, the US will see the merit of joining a peace process.

A negotiated peace can open the way for the economic transformation of Afghanistan and the entire region through trade, investment and economic integration, including under China's One Belt, One Road initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.


 

 

Pakistan,  China  finalising long-term plan for CPEC

Pakistan and China are working towards early finalisation of a Long-Term Plan (LTP) for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a Chinese diplomat confirmed on Monday.

There are expectations that it could be finalised during the Belt and Road summit being hosted by China on May 14 and 15. Pakistan is participating in the summit.

The LTP, which covers the projects to be undertaken till 2030, has been behind the timeline set for its adoption. Currently, short-to-medium term projects are being pursued under CPEC, which relate to energy, infrastructure and connectivity. The LTP, officials say, defines the overall direction, ideas and goals of cooperation from present till 2030.

Earlier, Political and Press Counsellor at the Chinese Embassy Jian Han, speaking at a roundtable conference on 'OBOR and CPEC from the Prism of China-Pakistan Bilateral Relations' organised by the Strategic Vision Institute (SVI), had said that the LTP 'would set the focus for CPEC construction in future'.

CPEC project director Hassan Daud Butt on the occasion said that Pakistan had already shared the draft LTP with China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) for approval and consideration for signing during the Belt and Road summit.

Mr Butt was also hopeful that Pakistan and China would soon conclude agreements for financing and construction of the Gwadar International Airport and East-Bay Expressway.

A Chinese diplomat separately told Dawn that PC-1 for both projects had been approved and an agreement was now being negotiated by the two governments.

Industrialisation phase

At the seminar, the CPEC director said that the project was set to enter the industrialisation phase.

Nine economic zones have been identified to be set up in different parts of the country. Currently feasibility studies are being undertaken and financial agreements are expected to be concluded by the next Joint Cooperation Committee meeting to be held later this year.

'We are expecting that by 2018 about 7,000MW of energy would be added to the national grid and linkages of eastern and western routes would be completed,' he said.

'The western route would be completed by July 2018, whereas eastern route would be ready by December 2018,' he said.

China now has a 'vested interest' in mediating between India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue because of its about $50 billion investment in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), an article in a state-run daily has said.

The article in the Global Times, a publication of the ruling Communist Party of China, indicated Beijing's interest in playing a bigger role in the region.

Saying that China had mediated between Myanmar and Bangladesh over the Rohingya issue, the article said: 'Given the massive investment that China has made in countries along the One Belt, One Road [project], China now has a vested interest in helping resolve regional conflicts including the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan.'

'...[W]hile China has the capability to resolve conflicts through mediation given its increased economic influence, the nation needs to be very prudent in dealing with other big powers, India included, in the region,' it said.

'In fact, mediating between India and Pakistan over Kashmir issue would perhaps be one of the toughest challenges facing China in dealing with regional affairs to safeguard its overseas interests,' the article said.

This is apparently the first time that Chinese official media has begun floating Beijing's interest in playing a mediatory role to resolve the Kashmir issue.

India has protested to China over CPEC and is yet to name an official delegation to take part in a summit on the 'One Belt, One Road' initiative, of which CPEC is a part.

The Cen­tral Development Working Party (CDWP) on Wed­nesday cleared a total of 16 development projects with an estimated cost of Rs130 billion, including two mass transit projects for Karachi and Peshawar.

The two projects are part of the China-Pakistan Eco­nomic Corridor (CPEC) and expected to be formally approved by the two nations on the sidelines of upcoming One Belt, One Road conference in China by mid-month.

The government has already granted a series of tax exemptions for mass transit projects.

The CWDP meeting, presided over by Minister for Planning, Development and Reform Ahsan Iqbal, forwarded seven mega projects to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) for approval. The projects related to energy, transport and communication, water resources and manpower sectors.

The CDWP also approved concept clearance papers of two projects, including construction of Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway (M6) worth Rs238bn and Sindh Renewable Energy Deve­lopment Project (SREDP) $122 million. It also re­­viewed two position papers of ongoing project in education and water resources sector worth Rs64bn.

In the transport and communication sector, the meeting recommended four major projects with a total cost of Rs102bn to Ecnec for approval because of limited financial powers of the CDWP. The CDWP can only approve projects having maximum cost of Rs3bn and is required to refer projects of higher cost to Ecnec after clearing them on technical grounds.

The meeting approved the revival of Karachi Circular Railway at a cost of Rs27.6bn. The project proposed by the Sindh government envisaged revival and construction of 43.2km double railway track with 24 stations and procurement of 162 locomotives.

The project rider-ship is estimated at 550,000 passengers per day in the opening year with projected demand of 749, 541 till 2030.

The provincial government was also asked to rationalise the project cost and ensure that the stations and other buildings to be constructed under the project matched the historical architecture of Karachi.

The meeting also app­roved Rs56.8bn for Pesha­war Sustainable Bus Rapid Transit Corridor Project of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. The project, plan­ned to be constructed with Rs48bn loan from the ADB, envisaged construction of 25.8km-long road track, 32 stations with commercial buildings and other allied facilities.

The project, planned to be executed in 12 months, is expected to facilitate 472,000 people per day in its initial phase. The provincial government was directed to ensure constructions of station and other building in line with historical architecture of Peshawar and allot separate enclosures for women.

The CDWP also approved a World Bank-financed Kara­­­chi Neighbourhood Improve­ment Project (KNIP) worth Rs10.5bn. The project proposed by the Sindh government envisaged improvement of roads, parks, government buildings and citizen services in the commercial hub of Pakistan. The provincial government was directed to prepare a clear plan for repayment of loans obtained for KNIP.

The meeting also app­roved Rs7bn project of construction of four-lane bridge across River Indus connecting Kallur Kot Bhakkar with Dhakki area of Dera Ismail Khan.

In the energy sector, CDWP approved 30-megwatt Hydro Power Project in Ghowari in Gilgat Baltistan with estimated cost of Rs7.9bn. The meeting also approved six projects worth Rs6.6bn relating to water resources. The projects include construction of three dams in Pashin and Loralai areas of Balochistan and recommended to Ecnec a Rs5bn project for raising of Baran Dam Project in Balochistan.

The CDWP also approved Prime Minister's Youth Skill Development Prog­ram­­me (Phase-IV) 2017-18 with an estimated cost of Rs6bn.

In the environment sector, the meeting approved construction of boundary wall of zoo-cum-botanical garden in Islamabad with a cost of Rs109 million.

The meeting also app­roved three projects in the education sector worth Rs3.16bn, including establishment of national facility for Lab­o­ra­tory Animal Re­­search and Care, enhancement of the research facilities at Uni­ver­sity of Vete­rinary and Animal Sciences, Ravi Campus Pat­toki (re­­vised) and schools and college curriculum development.

In the food and agriculture sector, the CDWP app­roved a project for strengthening and upgradation of Agriculture and Livestock Research System of Arid Zone Research Institute, Umerkot, Sindh, with estimated cost of Rs643 million.

Chinese Ambassa­dor Sun Weidong on Wednesday underscored the importance of Pakistan's role in promoting China's 'Belt and Road' initiative as he sought to dispel 'myths' about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.

'China and Pakistan can play a major role in promoting the Belt and Road initiative as all-weather strategic cooperative partners. Among the countries along the Belt and Road initiative, CPEC is one of the earliest, fastest and most effective project,' Ambassador Sun said while delivering a lecture on the 'Belt and Road' initiative jointly organised by the Chinese embassy and the Pakistan-China Institute.

The lecture was held in connection with the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation being held in China from May 14-15. Top leaders from 28 countries, including Pakistan, and representatives from 110 countries and 61 international organisations will take part in the forum. UN Secretary General António Guterres would also attend the forum.

The ambassador said that One Belt, One Road concept was based on traditional Chinese culture whose core values were peace, development and harmony.

He expressed satisfaction over the pace of projects under construction under the CPEC, noting that 19 early-harvest projects were under smooth construction with a total contract amount of $18.5 billion.

Mr Sun said China's projects under the CPEC would not create environmental problems for Pakistan, adding that Beijing would not transfer outdated capacity production here. Besides, he said, the CPEC would not increase the financial burden on Pakistan.

He said China would not pursue unilateral trade surplus with Pakistan and would welcome export of Pakistani products to China and would provide facilitation in this regard.

The chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on the CPEC, Senator Mushahid Hussain, said Pakistan-China ties had seen quantitative expansion.

Days after Chinese daily Global Times published a column highlighting Beijing's 'vested interest' in settlement of the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan, China's foreign ministry clarified that it would continue to adhere to a policy of non-interference on the issue, Dawn.com repor­ted on Thursday quoting IANS.

According to the column, due to massive investments made in the 'One Belt, One Road' initiative, China has a 'vested interest in helping resolve regional conflicts, including the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan'.

The column said that while China had always 'adhered to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries,' it can no longer turn a 'deaf ear to the demands of Chinese enterprises in protecting their overseas investments'.

The Chinese foreign ministry in a statement emailed to IANS was quoted as saying, 'China's position on the issue of Kashmir is clear and consistent. It is an issue left over from history between India and Pakistan and shall be properly addressed by India and Pakistan through consultation and negotiation.'

The statement added that building of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor had no bearing on Beijing's stance on the matter, and urged Pakistan and India to 'properly handle differences by increasing communication and dialogue, and jointly upholding regional peace and stability'. However, it added, Beijing is 'willing to make constructive efforts for the improvement of India-Pakistan relations'.

Frosty Pakistan-India relations were on full display in Japan when Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was on dais with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar, often sharing cold vibes and disagreeing over China's connectivity initiatives.

Mr Jaitley and Mr Dar were among the four speakers who took part in a debate organised by the CNBC news channel on the sidelines of the Asian Development Bank's 50th annual meeting.

The Indian minister sat with his head turned away from the Pakistani leader all through the one-hour debate and left immediately after a customary photo-op with panel members. There were no handshakes.

Mr Jaitley smiled just once, on a question about ride-sharing firm Uber facing difficult times in the US, and said: 'I think they are having a great time in India.'

When Mr Dar backed the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative to connect China with the rest of Eurasia, Mr Jaitley said India had 'serious reservations' on the proposal because of sovereignty issues.

'I think connectivity in principle is a good idea but the particular proposal which has just been suggested by you, I think there are several other collateral issues and this is not really the forum for me to go into all this,' he said.

Mr Dar, on the other hand, said: 'It is one of the very important directions to be connected in the region and beyond... I think OBOR is a very good initiative. Pakistan is a part of it and very much promotes the idea,' he said.

Mr Dar also said that intra-regional trade should be focused and regional connectivity should be improved. He went on to mention initiatives like the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, meant to link Pakistan, central Asian states, India and Iran. 'So inter-dependence is the way forward,' he said.

Mr Jaitley, however, said that India was not part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership but there was no force in the world which could stop trade. By arrangement with the Times of India


 
 

 China  invites India to join  One - Belt - One - Road  project

Chinese Ambassador Luo Zhaohui has called on India to join its One-Belt-One-Road project and assured New Delhi that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would not impinge on anyone's sovereign rights.

The Chinese embassy on Monday released the text of Mr Luo's remarks made to an Indian think-tank on Friday.

'Some people in the West misread China and tend to think that the 'Dragon' and the 'Elephant' are inevitable rivals, and that China would not like to see India developing. This conception is wrong. We hope to see India develop well and we are more than happy to help India develop to achieve common development,' he said in an address at the United Services Institute.

Despite recent tensions between the two countries, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have opportunities to meet each other on the sidelines of summits to be held by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , G20 and BRICS.

'We need to properly manage differences. As two large neighbours, it is natural that we have some differences. Even family members may have problems,' Mr Luo said.

There was a need to set a long-term vision for China-India relations. 'Here's my suggestion. First, start negotiations on a China-India 'treaty of good neighbourliness and friendly cooperation'.

'Second, restart negotiation on China-India free trade agreement. Third, strive for an early harvest on the border issue. Fourth, actively explore the feasibility of aligning China's 'One-Belt-One-Road Initiative' (OBOR) and India's 'Act East Policy',' he said.

The OBOR and regional connectivity could provide China and India with fresh opportunities and highlights for the bilateral cooperation. The OBOR is a major public product China has offered to the world. As close neighbours, China and India could be natural partners in connectivity and the OBOR.

'Now the GDP of India is roughly that of China in 2004, some 13 years ago. China leads India by 13 years, mainly because we started reform and opening up 13 years earlier,' Mr Luo said.

He said China and India differed in political systems and China enjoys stronger policy consistency. 'India's political system has its own advantages, but sometimes may cause fluctuations in its policies or at least in its pace of development. As soon as China set reform and opening-up as its centre task, the whole nation is in full sail.'

India still has reservations over the OBOR, saying that the CPEC passes through Azad Jammu and Kashmir, raising sovereignty concerns.

'China has no intention to get involved in the sovereignty and territorial disputes between India and Pakistan. China supports the solution of the disputes through bilateral negotiations between the two countries. The CPEC is for promoting economic cooperation and connectivity. It has no connections to or impact on sovereignty issues,' the envoy said.

He recalled that China and India have had successful experience of delinking sovereignty disputes with bilateral relations even earlier.

'In history, we have had close cooperation along the ancient Silk Road. Why shouldn't we support this kind of cooperation today? In a word, China is sincere in its intention to cooperate with India on the OBOR, as it is good for both of us.'

The perception that China was partial to Pakistan over others was erroneous. 'Some Indian media say that China always puts Pakistan first when handling its relations with South Asia countries. I want to tell you this is not true. Simply put, we always put China first and we deal with problems based on their own merits. Take Kashmir issue for example, we supported the relevant UN resolutions before 1990s. Then we supported a settlement through bilateral negotiation in line with the Simla Agreement. This is an example of China taking care of India's concern.'

On promoting India-Pakistan reconciliation, China hopes that both sides could live together in peace.

'The development of China, India, Pakistan and the stability of the whole region call for a stable and friendly environment. Otherwise, how could we open up and develop? That's why we say we are willing to mediate when India and Pakistan have problems. But the precondition is that both India and Pakistan accept it. We do this only out of goodwill. We do hope that there is no problem at all. When the Mumbai terrorist attack on Nov 26, 2008, took place, I was Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, and I did a lot of mediation at that time.'

China strongly opposes terrorism and is ready to work with India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the international community in fighting the menace.


 
 

CPEC's potential to break down political barriers discussed

Against the backdrop of China's invitation to India to join its One-Belt-One-Road (OBOR) project, Chinese Consul General Wang Yu on Monday said that one of the major purposes of building the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was to promote regional development and cooperation.

Talking to Dawn at an interactive session on 'Pakistan's Vision 2025 with special reference to CPEC as a Gateway to Pakistan's Future Prosperity' hosted by the Karachi Council on Foreign Affairs at a local hotel, Mr Yu said: 'The one-plus-four structure of cooperation of OBOR initiative with CPEC as a pillar will open avenues of regional collaboration in diverse fields not only in the short term but also the long term.'

Emphasising the need to promote diplomatic development, the ambassador, while addressing the session, said: 'The Silk Road business summit in Beijing to be held later this month will discuss prospects of new platforms and address problems related to global economy.'

The summit will be an important platform to encourage global connectivity as it will be attended by 28 world leaders, representatives of 110 countries and 61 international organisations, he added.

Speaking at the event, Sindh Governor Mohammad Zubair said: 'Out of the $60 billion invested by China in the project, $34bn will come to Pakistan. It is the biggest investment venture in the history of Pakistan and the real challenge is how to deploy it in the most effective manner.'

Appreciating Canadian High Commissioner Perry Calderwood's interest in CPEC, as well as of business councils of other countries, he said it was necessary for diplomats and businessmen to reflect upon the positive side of Pakistan. 'The reality is far better than the perception. Karachi is 90 per cent better as the financial hub of Pakistan than it was before. The city is safe, secure and blooming with business for foreign investment,' he stressed.

CPEC a game-changer?

Reflecting upon the potential of CPEC as a 'game-changer', keynote speaker of the session, senior economist Dr Kaiser Bengali commented: 'CPEC has the potential to break down age-old barriers. It can lead to a trade opening from the west between Gwadar and Chabahar port in Iran translating into a trans-shipping port.'

The shorter route from Hasan Abdal to Wagah could channel increased trade from the east as well, he added.

Talking about Balochistan's share in the corridor, Dr Bengali said the province could become a zero employment economy if half the total number of jobs [1.5 million] was created and issues of internal connectivity through accessibility and lack of skilled human resource were catered to.

'Pakistan's share in Gwadar is about 9pc only. Nobody is against CPEC, but potential risks and feasibility must be ensured for the project to benefit Pakistan,' he said, adding that there was an ambiguity as to what would be the provincial share from Gwadar-Khunjerab highway and the management of port revenue, protection of a foreign road and sea lanes.

The session was attended by the chairman of Korea-Pakistan Business and Friendship Council, presidents of Pakistan-Australia, Pakistan-Belgium, Pakistan-Russia, Pakistan-Japan, Pakistan-Iraq, Pakistan-France and Pakistan-German business forums as well as the Canadian high commissioner and other diplomats.

THE comments were made to an Indian audience, but they are of profound relevance here in Pakistan. In a recent speech to a think tank, the Chinese ambassador to India, Luo Zhaohui, who has also served as ambassador to Pakistan, invited India to join the One Belt, One Road project and reassured New Delhi that for all of China's close ties with Pakistan, China seeks stable and prosperous ties with India too. Mr Luo's comments come ahead of a major OBOR summit in Beijing, which India has declined to attend, and build on recent attempts by China to align India's so-called Act East policy with OBOR. For Pakistan, there are vital lessons to be drawn from the Chinese overtures to India. First, China's policy of putting trade ahead of disputes, and not just verbally emphasising but working practically for regional connectivity, is something that Pakistan must seriously consider emulating.

Second, Pakistani policymakers' reflexive argument that China is Pakistan's friend first in South Asia ought to be reconsidered in the light of the very sensible formulation by Mr Luo of a 'China first' policy national interest rightly trumping the more irrational hopes of even close allies.

There continues to be a great deal that divides India and China. The intensive military build-up by both countries, for example, may have extra-regional dimensions, but the simultaneous economic rise of China and India has hawks in each country worried about the ambitions of the other. Yet, rational voices in China and India have prevailed and pulled the countries into closer, near-irreversible economic ties. In setting out a long-term vision for China-India relations, Mr Luo, surely speaking with the explicit approval of Beijing, suggested four initiatives, three of which are economic in nature and only one 'strive for an early harvest of the border issue' pertaining to past conflict. Contrast the forward-looking, economy-focused message of China with Pakistan's relations with three of its four neighbours in recent times. True, officially Pakistan does endorse regional connectivity, but in practice it has only embraced CPEC; connectivity with other neighbours is being spurned for ever-more-militarised borders.

Mr Luo's comments are also a warning against giddy notions inside Pakistan that CPEC has solidified Pakistan as its greatest, and possibly only, ally in the South Asia region. With a simple but frank phrase, 'China first', Mr Luo demolished not just expectations that China will automatically side with Pakistan in its disputes with India but also drove a stake through hyperbolic assertions that CPEC and Pakistan's ties with China will help achieve a fair and just settlement on Kashmir. Indeed, policymakers here should be thankful to Mr Luo and his superiors in Beijing for their clarity and for offering Pakistan a template to follow. A 'Pakistan first' national security and foreign policy could help reduce the many situations of conflict this country finds itself in regionally.


 
 

In Chichawatni, PM lambastes political adversaries

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday advised his political opponents to respect their elders as he paid a short visit to Chichawatni tehsil where he announced development projects worth Rs600m for a constituency said to be a stronghold of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).

He was visiting the constituency on the invitation of MNA Mian Tufail Jutt, who had defeated a PTI candidate in a by-election last year. The PM opened his address to an audience of nearly 20,000 people by criticising the politics of confrontation adopted by his rivals. In a thinly veiled reference to the PTI, he said politics was a gentleman's game which required a culture of respect, 'but our opponents lack high moral values'.

He added that his rivals fabricated bogus allegations every other day but they meant nothing to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).

Rs600m uplift projects announced for constituency considered PTI stronghold

Earlier, PM Sharif arrived in a chopper at a public school and went to inaugurate a model cattle market which, he announced, would benefit 80,000 farmers and bring Rs1.2bn investment to the area.

The PM then headed to the Rai Ali Nawaz Stadium to address a public gathering. The night before, a heavy dust storm had blown away the tent set up for his address and several banners announcing the prime minister's visit, but the local administration had worked fast to set them right back up before the PM's arrival at around noon.

Addressing the gathering, PM Sharif announced a Rs100m grant to provide electricity to NA-162, a rural constituency, during the current financial year, adding that 'there will be no loadshedding after 2018'.

Addressing farmers in the audience, the prime minister said his government had given them a lot of relief by slashing the prices of urea, DAP and electricity.

Most of the audience comprised farmers from the rural areas of NA-162 and NA-163. Local lawmakers had held several corner meetings ahead of the PM's visit to mobilise them because they had feared that the farmers would be busy with the wheat harvest.

The prime minister said he had been visiting Chichawatni since he was a child. 'I love the people of Chichawatni and I know they love me too.'

However, for many, the prime minister's visit and the announcement of millions of rupees worth of development projects appeared a political gesture for the benefit of PTI supporters in NA-162.

Although the PTI lost a seat to the PML-N in a by-election after the Supreme Court removed Rai Hassan Nawaz for concealing his assets, it is generally believed the powerful Rai family will manage to keep their vote bank, in the urban and rural areas of NA-162, intact.

Interestingly enough, PTI ticket holders had won 55 per cent of the municipal committee chairman's seats in Chichawatni in the local government elections. The PTI won 12 seats, the PML-N 8, and four independent candidates had won. Rana Ajmal of the PTI had become the municipal committee chairman even though he was up against a PML-N candidate nominated by MNA Mian Tufail Jutt.

Sharif leaves for China today

According to Media, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will proceed to China on Friday to attend the 'Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation' being held in Beijing on May 14 and 15.

The prime minister will be accompanied by a high-level delegation and chief ministers of the four provinces, said a press release issued by the PM House on Thursday.

Prime Minister Sharif, who will speak at the concluding session, will also visit Hangzhou and Hong Kong where he will interact with business leaders and attend investment conferences.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued a banking licence to the Bank of China, a press release said on Saturday.

The bank will commence its business in branch mode after meeting other regulatory requirements. It is a subsidiary of China Central Huijin, investment arm of the Chinese government.

The bank also operates beyond the Chinese mainland, with footprints in as many as 50 countries. Nineteen of those countries are located across the Chinese One-Belt-One-Road initiative.

At the end of 2015, the bank had a total of 11,633 institutions, including 644 in overseas markets. It is the fourth and fifth largest global bank in terms of tier-1 capital and total assets, respectively. It is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

The bank will initially bring $50 million to fulfil the minimum capital requirements of the SBP. The long-term objective of the Bank of China is to increase its market penetration by opening branches in major cities of Pakistan.

The bank aims to provide differential and specialised banking services to effectively serve the financing needs of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)-related projects by leveraging on its experience and global technology platform.

The Bank of China is the second Chinese bank to enter Pakistan. It will soon open its first branch in Karachi and gradually expand its network to other cities.

Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar met Tian Guoli, chairman of the Bank of China, on Saturday. In his last visit to Pakistan, Mr Tian had expressed the desire to launch banking operations in Pakistan and sought the SBP's permission.

The minister welcomed the decision by the Bank of China to commence its banking operations in Pakistan. He asked Mr Tian to visit Pakistan and inaugurate the first branch.


 
 

OBOR summit

IT might yet be the largest delegation from any country attending the One Belt, One Road summit in Beijing that was seen alighting from the aircraft on Friday. Pakistan's delegation consists of 11 senior leaders - from the prime minister to all four chief ministers - five members of the cabinet and the prime minister's adviser on foreign affairs. Then they are a number of other junior officials who have been blessed with an invitation to travel with this group to Beijing. The OBOR summit is an important event for Pakistan, whose participation is crucial by virtue of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and high-level representation is necessary. But although there are important memorandums of understanding to be signed, one wonders how many of the delegates have come because their attendance is actually required, and how many have taken it as a joyride and a chance to press the flesh.

Most other countries in attendance have opted to send far leaner delegations, because this is, after all, about diplomacy and business. It is not a wedding ceremony.

We are entitled to ask how many of the agreements and MoUs that are signed during this trip will be shared with the public or parliament. Most importantly, when does the government intend to make the long-term plan for CPEC, which is going to be finalised on this occasion, public. All other economic documents that have a far-reaching impact on the economy are made public, so why should this document be an exception? Since Pakistan's leadership has chosen to represent the country with such force at this summit, perhaps they can now opt to communicate the understandings reached during it with equal emphasis to their own people back home. China is embarking on a historic venture with the OBOR initiative, and although the real fruits of the venture will take time to materialise, it is crucial for Pakistanis to know what exactly they are agreeing to, and what sort of changes they should expect. Thus far, CPEC has been little more than several rounds of smiles and handshakes for people here, and a growing number of them are now asking when the bill is expected, and how much it is estimated to be. Perhaps the visiting delegates should be required to present a detailed report to the national parliament and the provincial assemblies on all that they did during this visit.


 
 

LoC violence

THE pattern of violence along the Line of Control in the disputed Kashmir region is familiar, but against a backdrop of an unravelling security and political situation in India-held Kashmir, the latest LoC tensions are particularly troubling. The usual set of accusations and recriminations have followed the violence over the weekend along the LoC: Pakistan has accused India of targeting local populations across the LoC; India claims it was Pakistan that started the exchange of fire. And as ever the brunt of the violence has been borne by the local population - numerous injured and several reportedly dead by Sunday. With Pakistan's civilian leadership in Beijing for the One Belt, One Road summit and India declining to participate because of its objections to CPEC projects linked to China through the Gilgit-Baltistan region, the cross-LoC violence is also a reminder that the local and the regional are closely connected in Kashmir.

For Pakistan, the challenge remains the same. Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa has been a frequent visitor to the LoC in recent times and has had a consistent message: Pakistan will defend itself against Indian belligerence while drawing international attention to India's crimes against the people of IHK. It is a sensible approach and should be complemented by counselling restraint to local commanders along the LoC. If India is keen on escalating conflict to draw attention away from the trouble it faces in the occupied territory, Pakistan should not allow attempted Indian diversions to succeed. Since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office three years ago, there have been periodic tests, varying in intensity, of Pakistan's resolve along the LoC. By now, Pakistan should be able to separate genuine incidents from possible Indian attempts to cause a flare-up along the LoC for political purposes.

On the political front, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Mr Modi need to return to the path of dialogue urgently. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Kazakhstan presents an early opportunity, especially since the gathering will mark the accession of India and Pakistan to the SCO. The absence of dialogue has allowed Mr Modi to pursue ever more aggressive policies in IHK and for all of Pakistan's attempts to bring global attention to bear on India's violence against the Kashmiri people, the whole spectrum of Pakistan's relations and disputes with India has suffered. Indeed, for hawks in both countries, the argument that dialogue in current conditions is meaningless is part of the problem - arguably, it is the absence of dialogue that has allowed the situation in IHK to worsen and Pak-India tensions to remain at worryingly highs levels. Mr Sharif has shown great courage in adhering to his dialogue-focused approach to India. The Indian prime minister needs to reciprocate and demonstrate that he truly understands the demands of statesmanship.

Plan eyes agriculture Large surveillance system for cities Visa-free entry for Chinese nationals

THE floodgates are about to open. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif arrived in Beijing over the weekend to participate in the One Belt, One Road summit, and the top item on his agenda is to finalise the Long Term Plan (LTP) for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. [See Box on Page 4 for details on how the plan was made].

Dawn has acquired exclusive access to the original document, and for the first time its details are being publically disclosed here. The plan lays out in detail what Chinese intentions and priorities are in Pakistan for the next decade and a half, details that have not been discussed in public thus far.

For instance, thousands of acres of agricultural land will be leased out to Chinese enterprises to set up 'demonstration projects' in areas ranging from seed varieties to irrigation technology. A full system of monitoring and surveillance will be built in cities from Peshawar to Karachi, with 24 hour video recordings on roads and busy marketplaces for law and order. A national fibreoptic backbone will be built for the country not only for internet traffic, but also terrestrial distribution of broadcast TV, which will cooperate with Chinese media in the 'dissemination of Chinese culture'.

The plan envisages a deep and broad-based penetration of most sectors of Pakistan's economy as well as its society by Chinese enterprises and culture. Its scope has no precedent in Pakistan's history in terms of how far it opens up the domestic economy to participation by foreign enterprises. In some areas the plan seeks to build on a market presence already established by Chinese enterprises, eg Haier in household appliances, ChinaMobile and Huawei in telecommunications and China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) in mining and minerals.

In other cases, such as textiles and garments, cement and building materials, fertiliser and agricultural technologies (among others) it calls for building the infrastructure and a supporting policy environment to facilitate fresh entry. A key element in this is the creation of industrial parks, or special economic zones, which 'must meet specified conditions, including availability of water…perfect infrastructure, sufficient supply of energy and the capacity of self service power', according to the plan.

But the main thrust of the plan actually lies in agriculture, contrary to the image of CPEC as a massive industrial and transport undertaking, involving power plants and highways. The plan acquires its greatest specificity, and lays out the largest number of projects and plans for their facilitation, in agriculture.

Agriculture

For agriculture, the plan outlines an engagement that runs from one end of the supply chain all the way to the other. From provision of seeds and other inputs, like fertiliser, credit and pesticides, Chinese enterprises will also operate their own farms, processing facilities for fruits and vegetables and grain. Logistics companies will operate a large storage and transportation system for agrarian produce.

It identifies opportunities for entry by Chinese enterprises in the myriad dysfunctions that afflict Pakistan's agriculture sector. For instance, 'due to lack of cold-chain logistics and processing facilities, 50% of agricultural products go bad during harvesting and transport', it notes.

Enterprises entering agriculture will be offered extraordinary levels of assistance from the Chinese government. They are encouraged to '[m]ake the most of the free capital and loans' from various ministries of the Chinese government as well as the China Development Bank. The plan also offers to maintain a mechanism that will 'help Chinese agricultural enterprises to contact the senior representatives of the Government of Pakistan and China'.

The government of China will 'actively strive to utilize the national special funds as the discount interest for the loans of agricultural foreign investment'. In the longer term the financial risk will be spread out, through 'new types of financing such as consortium loans, joint private equity and joint debt issuance, raise funds via multiple channels and decentralize financing risks'.

The plan proposes to harness the work of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps to bring mechanization as well as scientific technique in livestock breeding, development of hybrid varieties and precision irrigation to Pakistan. It sees its main opportunity as helping the Kashgar Prefecture, a territory within the larger Xinjiang Autonomous Zone, which suffers from a poverty incidence of 50 per cent, and large distances that make it difficult to connect to larger markets in order to promote development. The prefecture's total output in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery amounted to just over $5 billion in 2012, and its population was less than 4 million in 2010, hardly a market with windfall gains for Pakistan.

However, for the Chinese, this is the main driving force behind investing in Pakistan's agriculture, in addition to the many profitable opportunities that can open up for their enterprises from operating in the local market. The plan makes some reference to export of agriculture goods from the ports, but the bulk of its emphasis is focused on the opportunities for the Kashgar Prefecture and Xinjiang Production Corps, coupled with the opportunities for profitable engagement in the domestic market.

The plan discusses those engagements in considerable detail. Ten key areas for engagement are identified along with seventeen specific projects. They include the construction of one NPK fertilizer plant as a starting point 'with an annual output of 800,000 tons'. Enterprises will be inducted to lease farm implements, like tractors, 'efficient plant protection machinery, efficient energy saving pump equipment, precision fertilization drip irrigation equipment' and planting and harvesting machinery.

Meat processing plants in Sukkur are planned with annual output of 200,000 tons per year, and two demonstration plants processing 200,000 tons of milk per year. In crops, demonstration projects of more than 6,500 acres will be set up for high yield seeds and irrigation, mostly in Punjab. In transport and storage, the plan aims to build 'a nationwide logistics network, and enlarge the warehousing and distribution network between major cities of Pakistan' with a focus on grains, vegetables and fruits. Storage bases will be built first in Islamabad and Gwadar in the first phase, then Karachi, Lahore and another in Gwadar in the second phase, and between 2026-2030, Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar will each see another storage base.

Asadabad, Islamabad, Lahore and Gwadar will see a vegetable processing plant, with annual output of 20,000 tons, fruit juice and jam plant of 10,000 tons and grain processing of 1 million tons. A cotton processing plant is also planned initially, with output of 100,000 tons per year.

'We will impart advanced planting and breeding techniques to peasant households or farmers by means of land acquisition by the government, renting to China-invested enterprises and building planting and breeding bases' it says about the plan to source superior seeds.

In each field, Chinese enterprises will play the lead role. 'China-invested enterprises will establish factories to produce fertilizers, pesticides, vaccines and feedstuffs' it says about the production of agricultural materials.

'China-invested enterprises will, in the form of joint ventures, shareholding or acquisition, cooperate with local enterprises of Pakistan to build a three-level warehousing system (purchase and storage warehouse, transit warehouse and port warehouse)' it says about warehousing.

Then it talks about trade. 'We will actively embark on cultivating surrounding countries in order to improve import and export potential of Pakistani agricultural products and accelerate the trade of agricultural products. In the early stages, we will gradually create a favorable industry image and reputation for Pakistan by relying on domestic demand.'

In places the plan appears to be addressing investors in China. It says Chinese enterprises should seek 'coordinated cooperation with Pakistani enterprises' and 'maintain orderly competition and mutual coordination.' It advises them to make an effort 'seeking for powerful strategic partners for bundling interest in Pakistan.'

As security measures, enterprises will be advised 'to respect the religions and customs of the local people, treat people as equals and live in harmony'. They will also be advised to 'increase local employment and contribute to local society by means of subcontracting and consortiums.' In the final sentence of the chapter on agriculture, the plan says the government of China will '[s]trengthen the safety cooperation with key countries, regions and international organizations, jointly prevent and crack down on terrorist acts that endanger the safety of Chinese overseas enterprises and their staff.'

The plan states at the outset that the corridor 'spans Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and whole Pakistan in spatial range'. It's main aim is to connect South Xinjiang with Pakistan. It is divided into a 'core area' and what they call the 'radiation zones', those territories that will feel the knock on effects of the work being done in the core area. The core area includes 'Kashgar, Tumshuq, Atushi and Akto of Kizilsu Kirghiz of Xinjiang' from China, and 'most of Islamabad's Capital territory, Punjab, and Sindh, and some areas of Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, and Balochistan' from Pakistan. It has 'one belt, three passages, and two axes and five functional zones', where the belt is 'the strip area formed by important arterial traffic in China and Pakistan".

Industry

For industry, the plan trifurcates the country into three zones: western and northwestern, central and southern. Each zone is marked to receive specific industries in designated industrial parks, of which only a few are actually mentioned. The western and northwestern zone, covering most of Balochistan and KP province, is marked for mineral extraction, with potential in chrome ore, 'gold reserves hold a considerable potential, but are still at the exploration stage', and diamonds. One big mineral product that the plan discusses is marble. Already, China is Pakistan's largest buyer of processed marble, at almost 80,000 tons per year. The plan looks to set up 12 marble and granite processing sites in locations ranging from Gilgit and Kohistan in the north, to Khuzdar in the south.

The central zone is marked for textiles, household appliances and cement. Four separate locations are pointed out for future cement clusters: Daudkhel, Khushab, Esakhel and Mianwali. The case of cement is interesting, because the plan notes that Pakistan is surplus in cement capacity, then goes on to say that 'in the future, there is a larger space of cooperation for China to invest in the cement process transformation'.

For the southern zone, the plan recommends that 'Pakistan develop petrochemical, iron and steel, harbor industry, engineering machinery, trade processing and auto and auto parts (assembly)' due to the proximity of Karachi and its ports. This is the only part in the report where the auto industry is mentioned in any substantive way, which is a little surprising because the industry is one of the fastest growing in the country. The silence could be due to lack of interest on the part of the Chinese to acquire stakes, or to diplomatic prudence since the sector is, at the moment, entirely dominated by Japanese companies (Toyota, Honda and Suzuki).

Gwadar, also in the southern zone, 'is positioned as the direct hinterland connecting Balochistan and Afghanistan.' As a CPEC entreport, the plan recommends that it be built into 'a base of heavy and chemical industries, such as iron and steel/petrochemical'. It notes that 'some Chinese enterprises have started investment and construction in Gwadar' taking advantage of its 'superior geographical position and cheap shipping costs to import crude oil from the Middle East, iron ore and coking coal resources from South Africa and New Zealand' for onward supply to the local market 'as well as South Asia and Middle East after processing at port.'

The plan shows great interest in the textiles industry in particular, but the interest is focused largely on yarn and coarse cloth. The reason, as the plan lays out, is that in Xinjiang the textile industry has already attained higher levels of productivity. Therefore, 'China can make the most of the Pakistani market in cheap raw materials to develop the textiles and garments industry and help soak up surplus labor forces in Kashgar'. The ensuing strategy is described cryptically as the principle of 'introducing foreign capital and establishing domestic connections as a crossover of West and East'.

Preferential policies will be necessary to attract enterprises to come to the newly built industrial parks envisioned under the plan. The areas where such preferences need to be extended are listed in the plan as 'land, tax, logistics and services' as well as land price, 'enterprise income tax, tariff reduction and exemption and sales tax rate.'

Fibreoptics and surveillance

One of the oldest priorities for the Chinese government since talks on CPEC began is fibreoptic connectivity between China and Pakistan. An MoU for such a link was signed in July 2013, at a time when CPEC appeared to be little more than a road link between Kashgar and Gwadar. But the plan reveals that the link goes far beyond a simple fibreoptic set up.

China has various reasons for wanting a terrestrial fibreoptic link with Pakistan, including its own limited number of submarine landing stations and international gateway exchanges which can serve as a bottleneck to future growth of internet traffic. This is especially true for the western provinces. 'Moreover, China's telecom services to Africa need to be transferred in Europe, so there is certain hidden danger of the overall security' says the plan. Pakistan has four submarine cables to handle its internet traffic, but only one landing station, which raises security risks as well.

So the plan envisages a terrestrial cable across the Khunjerab pass to Islamabad, and a submarine landing station in Gwadar, linked to Sukkur. From there, the backbone will link the two in Islamabad, as well as all major cities in Pakistan.

The expanded bandwidth that will open up will enable terrestrial broadcast of digital HD television, called Digital Television Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB). This is envisioned as more than just a technological contribution. It is a 'cultural transmission carrier. The future cooperation between Chinese and Pakistani media will be beneficial to disseminating Chinese culture in Pakistan, further enhancing mutual understanding between the two peoples and the traditional friendship between the two countries.' The plan says nothing about how the system will be used to control the content of broadcast media, nor does it say anything more about 'the future cooperation between Chinese and Pakistani media'.

It also seeks to create an electronic monitoring and control system for the border in Khunjerab, as well as run a 'safe cities' project. The safe city project will deploy explosive detectors and scanners to 'cover major roads, case-prone areas and crowded places…in urban areas to conduct real-time monitoring and 24 hour video recording.' Signals gathered from the surveillance system will be transmitted to a command centre, but the plan says nothing about who will staff the command centre, what sort of signs they will look for, and who will provide the response.

'There is a plan to build a pilot safe city in Peshawar, which faces a fairly severe security situation in northwestern Pakistan' the plan says, following which the program will be extended to major cities such as Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, hinting that the feeds will be shared eventually, and perhaps even recorded.

Tourism and recreation

One of the most intriguing chapters in the plan is the one that talks about the development of a 'coastal tourism' industry. It speaks of a long belt of coastal enjoyment industry that includes yacht wharfs, cruise homeports, nightlife, city parks, public squares, theaters, golf courses and spas, hot spring hotels and water sports. The belt will run from Keti Bunder to Jiwani, the last habitation before the Iranian border. Then, somewhat disappointingly, it adds that 'more work needs to be done' before this vision can be realized.

The plans are laid out in surprising detail. For instance, Gwadar will feature international cruise clubs that 'provide marine tourists private rooms that would feel as though they were 'living in the ocean''. And just as the feeling sinks in, it goes on to say that '[f]or the development of coastal vacation products, Islamic culture, historical culture, folk culture and marine culture shall all be integrated.' Apparently more work needs to be done here too.

For Ormara, the plan recommends building 'unique recreational activities' that would also encourage 'the natural, exciting, participatory, sultry, and tempting characteristics' to come through. For Keti Bunder it recommends wildlife sanctuaries, an aquarium and a botanical garden. For Sonmiani, on the eastern edge of Karachi, 'projects like a coastal beach, extended greenway, coastal villa, car camp, SPA, beach playground and a seafood street can be developed.'

It is an expansive vision that the plan lays out, and towards the end, it asks for the following: 'Make the visa-free tourism possible with China to provide more convenient policy support for Chinese tourists to Pakistan.' There is no mention of a reciprocal arrangement for Pakistani nationals visiting China.

Finance and risk

In any plan, the question of financial resources is always crucial. The long term plan drawn up by the China Development Bank is at its sharpest when discussing Pakistan's financial sector, government debt market, depth of commercial banking and the overall health of the financial system. It is at its most unsentimental when drawing up the risks faced by long term investments in Pakistan's economy.

The chief risk the plan identifies is politics and security. 'There are various factors affecting Pakistani politics, such as competing parties, religion, tribes, terrorists, and Western intervention' the authors write. 'The security situation is the worst in recent years'. The next big risk, surprisingly, is inflation, which the plan says has averaged 11.6 per cent over the past 6 years. 'A high inflation rate means a rise of project-related costs and a decline in profits.'

Efforts will be made, says the plan, to furnish 'free and low interest loans to Pakistan' once the costs of the corridor begin to come in. But this is no free ride, it emphasizes. 'Pakistan's federal and involved local governments should also bear part of the responsibility for financing through issuing sovereign guarantee bonds, meanwhile protecting and improving the proportion and scale of the government funds invested in corridor construction in the financial budget.'

It asks for financial guarantees 'to provide credit enhancement support for the financing of major infrastructure projects, enhance the financing capacity, and protect the interests of creditors.' Relying on the assessments of the IMF, World Bank and the ADB, it notes that Pakistan's economy cannot absorb FDI much above $2 billion per year without giving rise to stresses in its economy. 'It

is recommended that China's maximum annual direct investment in Pakistan should be around US$1 billion.' Likewise, it concludes that Pakistan's ceiling for preferential loans should be $1 billion, and for non preferential loans no more than $1.5 billion per year.

It advises its own enterprises to take precautions to protect their own investments. 'International business cooperation with Pakistan should be conducted mainly with the government as a support, the banks as intermediary agents and enterprises as the mainstay.' Nor is the growing engagement some sort of brotherly involvement. 'The cooperation with Pakistan in the monetary and financial areas aims to serve China's diplomatic strategy.'

The other big risk the plan refers to is exchange rate risk, after noting the severe weakness in Pakistan's ability to earn foreign exchange. To mitigate this, the plan proposes tripling the size of the swap mechanism between the RMB and the Pakistani rupee to 30 billion Yuan, diversifying power purchase payments beyond the dollar into RMB and rupee basket, tapping the Hong Kong market for RMB bonds, and diversifying enterprise loans from a wide array of sources. The growing role of the RMB in Pakistan's economy is a clearly stated objective of the measures proposed.

Conclusion

It is not clear how much of the plan will be earnestly followed up and how much is there simply to evince interest from the Pakistani side. In the areas of interest contained in the plan, it appears access to the full supply chain of the agrarian economy is a top priority for the Chinese. After that the capacity of the textile spinning sector to serve the raw material needs of Xinjiang, and the garment and value added sector to absorb Chinese technology is another priority. Next is the growing domestic market, particularly in cement and household appliances, which receive detailed treatment in the plan. And lastly, through greater financial integration, the plan seeks to advance the internationalization of the RMB, as well as diversify the risks faced by Chinese enterprises entering Pakistan.

Gwadar receives passing mention as an economic prospect, mainly for its capacity to serve as a port of exit for minerals from Balochistan and Afghanistan, and as an entreport for wider trade in the greater Indian Ocean zone from South Africa to New Zealand. There is no mention of China's external trade being routed through Gwadar. Judging from their conversations with the government, it appears that the Pakistanis are pushing the Chinese to begin work on the Gwadar International Airport, whereas the Chinese are pushing for early completion of the Eastbay Expressway.

But the entry of Chinese firms will not be limited to the CPEC framework alone, as the recent acquisition of the Pakistan Stock Exchange, and the impending acquisition of K Electric demonstrate. In fact, CPEC is only the opening of the door. What comes through once that door has been opened is difficult to forecast.

How the plan was made

The long term plan was begun in November 2013 (see detailed timeline on dawn.com), when the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of the Government of China asked the China Development Bank (CDB) to compile a detailed roadmap to guide the engagement with Pakistan that had begun in May of that same year. For the next two years, till December 2015, the CDB worked with teams from the NDRC, as well as the ministries of Transport, National Energy Administration and China Tourism Planning Institute to develop a detailed plan to be implemented over the next 15 years, till the year 2030, that will open the doors for Chinese enterprises - private and public - to enter every area of Pakistan's economy.

Chinese expert teams made multiple visits to Pakistan and Xinjiang during this period, drawing up a detailed picture of the situation in every area, prioritising those that will come first, and identifying 'hidden dangers', bottlenecks and risks that should be anticipated along the way.

The report was first transmitted to the Government of Pakistan in June 2015, where it gathered dust for a few months. Under prodding from the Chinese government, a team from Pakistan met their counterparts in Beijing on Nov 12, 2015 and gave their feedback. A 'special bilateral meeting' was held on Dec 2nd, and the plan finalised on Dec 29th. It was then agreed by both sides that final signatures of the highest authorities, in Pakistan's case the Prime Minister, would be obtained by March 31st. That deadline was missed, and the signatures are expected to be placed now that the PM is in Beijing.

In the meantime, a small formality asserted itself. For the plan to be finalised, the assent of the provincial governments was required. For that purpose, a second draft was prepared that could be shared with the provincial authorities. That draft is 31 pages long and significantly watered down with all details removed, containing only broad brushstroke descriptions of the 'areas of cooperation' that both countries have identified.

The original plan drawn up by the CDB is 231 pages long, and is an astonishingly detailed roadmap of the pitfalls and opportunities that Chinese enterprises can expect as they venture into every area of the economy and society. It contains specifics of what is going to be built by the Chinese over the next decade and a half, and its detailed description of Pakistan's economy and its attendant risks shows clearly that the Chinese are fully aware of what they are getting involved in.

RECENTLY India took the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav to the International Court of Justice but it should know Kulbhushan's case is a bilateral issue.

Some diplomats think it would give an option to Pakistan to justifiably take other bilateral issues to international forums. India suffered another setback by skipping the One Belt One Road (OBOR) summit at Beijing. India's objection was based on a very weak contention that 'no country can accept a project (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) that ignores its core concern on sovereignty and territorial integrity.'

Here, India forgot that Pakistan also claims sovereignty over the whole of the territory where India is building many hydropower projects in violation of the Indus Water Treaty and UN resolutions.

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah announced on Tuesday that groundbreaking of the long-awaited Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) would be performed in September.

'This is the good news I am sharing with the people of Karachi,' he said at a press conference held at the CM House to brief the media on his four-day visit to China. He was accompanied by provincial ministers Dr Sikandar Mandhro, Syed Nasir Shah and Imdad Pitafi.

He said the presence of all the four chief ministers with the prime minister at the One Belt, One Road conference in Beijing was lauded by the Chinese president.

Mr Shah said he had attended the JCCI meeting in Beijing in December last year, where three projects KCR, Keti Bandar Power Park and Special Economic Zone were included in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Simultaneously, the Sindh government was told to complete feasibility of the KCR within three months. 'We had completed it well in time and got it approved from the CDWP as well,' he said.

He said that during his visit to China he held a meeting with Chinese Transport Minister Lixiao Peng and NDRC officials and briefed them on the KCR and the progress made so far.

CM Shah said he also met Chinese Exim Bank vice-president and urged him to clear and approve loan for the KCR for which the latter nominated his general manager as focal person for the project.

He said Peshawar and Quetta metros had also been included in CPEC's transport projects. 'Since their feasibilities could not be completed, all such reports, including that of the KCR, would be submitted to the joint working meeting over the next two months for further approval.'

The chief minister said that he, along with Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal, held a meeting with the Chinese minister for national development reform committee and discussed with him the KCR project. The Chinese minister, according to the CM, said he would convene a meeting of the joint working group to approve the metro projects of Peshawar and Quetta and the KCR. 'I offered him to host the meeting in Karachi for which he said it would be decided shortly,' he added.

'We would perform groundbreaking of the KCR in September,' he said, adding that encroachments along the project's route were being removed.

The chief minister claimed that the Exim Bank's official had agreed to support energy projects in Sindh. He said work on the Special Economic Zone and Keti Bandar projects had begun.

'Altaf 2'

In reply to a question, the chief minister said his administration had allowed the Pak Sarzameen Party to take out a rally up to the FTC building on Sharea Faisal, but the party violated it and started marching towards the 'red zone'.

'That was why water cannon and teargas were used to get them dispersed. The government would not allow any party or group to block the main artery of the city. The language he [PSP chairman Mustafa Kamal] is using for others is quite pathetic. He is trying to become Altaf Hussain 2,' Mr Shah said.

He said he was in constant touch with the Frontier Works Organisation for early completion of the bulk water supply project of K-IV phase-I.

Transporters' strike

About the strike by goods transporters, the chief minister said the court had issued an order under which the movement of heavy vehicles in the city had been banned. He said Transport Minister Nasir Shah was holding talks with the transporters to get the strike called off. However, he said, his government would file a review petition in the court to resolve the issue.


 
 

OBOR connectivity shunned

ALL historic opportunities come with an element of risk. It is, therefore, quite appropriate to ask hard questions about the financing and affordability of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and to which country will accrue the majority of gains in the years and decades ahead.

At the same time, it is necessary to acknowledge that CPEC is only one plank, an important one no doubt, of the vast One Belt, One Road project that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made the centrepiece of his rule a developmental and an infrastructure-building spree on a scale that the world has not seen since the end of the Second World War.

While the US, architect of the current global economic and political order, has fretted that OBOR amounts to China's first attempt to redraw the global order, there is an undeniable opportunity at the heart of the venture.

If engaged with sensibly and pragmatically, OBOR could help all of China's trading partners and regional neighbours, big and small, realise collective gains. That makes India's decision to boycott the OBOR summit all the more puzzling. Even the US and Japan sent delegations to the summit in Beijing.

Explore: Is India trying to convince the world China's OBOR plan is secretly colonial?

The Indian foreign ministry's official reasons for declining to participate are contradictory. Citing India's own Act East, Neighbourhood First and Go West policies, the ministry spokesperson has claimed that connectivity is at the heart of Indian foreign policy.

But the spokesperson has rejected that very connectivity through OBOR on the pretext of debt traps and financial responsibility a bizarre form of diplomacy where India appears to believe that it is better placed to interpret the national interest of third countries and the sovereign decisions they are making than those countries themselves.

Even the objection to CPEC because of the claim that the Gilgit-Baltistan region is integral to the Kashmir issue is self-defeating; CPEC is only a part of OBOR, which has already drawn in virtually all of India's neighbours.

It is as if India believes that by ignoring OBOR, it can thwart its vast effects on the region. In reality, even the most cautious cooperative approach by India could yield significant benefits for both India and the region.

From a Pakistan-centric approach too, the Indian approach makes little sense. As the relationship between China and India itself has shown, trade and economic cooperation can reduce political tensions and create enough incentives for long-term disputes to not turn into open conflict. If OBOR succeeds even to a small extent, it could draw the wider region into a virtuous cycle of trade and prosperity that could cause the spectre of conflict among the region's three major military powers to recede.

Perhaps India sees itself as a global power to rival China eventually, but that does not mean it should spurn sensible opportunities in the interim. India should reconsider its stance on OBOR.


 
 

 China 's new world order

CHINA recently hosted 29 heads of state and government at the Belt and Road Forum, reinforcing the country's claim to leadership of an emerging geopolitical and economic world order. The summit conference that also attracted representatives of more than 40 other countries and multilateral financial agencies was the clearest expression yet of China breaking out of its old foreign policy mould that had restrained it from attempting a global role.

China's multibillion-dollar One Belt, One Road (OBOR) infrastructure development project linking the old Silk Road with Europe, is a manifestation of China's growing geopolitical ambitions. A brainchild of President Xi Jinping, perhaps, the most powerful Chinese leader after Mao Zedong, OBOR has now been under development for four years, spanning 68 countries and accounting for up to 40 per cent of global GDP.

President Xi's ambition of propelling China to centre stage of the global power game represents a sharp departure from the approach of previous Chinese leaders who strictly adhered to Deng Xiaoping's tenet to 'hide our capabilities and bide our time, never try to take the lead'. Thus over the past two decades, China has avoided being drawn into global conflicts and has completely focused its energies on development that helped it to become an economic superpower.

China's push to take the world leadership has come at a time when a strong anti-globalisation wave is sweeping the Western world that is showing a growing tendency of returning to more protectionist regimes. The United States under the Trump administration with its inward-looking approach has virtually abandoned the mantle of globalisation thus ceding greater space to Beijing's assertion.

It is evident that OBOR is not just about infrastructure development.

It is not surprising that the OBOR initiative is being embraced by a wide range of countries from Asia and Africa to Europe and even South America, notwithstanding some serious concerns about the cost and benefits of the enormously ambitious project. Surely fewer European countries showed up at the Beijing summit because of their reservations over China's reluctance to open doors to foreign companies.

While addressing the forum, President Xi tried to alleviate concerns about China's dominance, inviting other countries to take part in the project. China is spending roughly $150bn a year in the 68 countries that have so far signed on to the plan. According to Chinese government figures, around $1 trillion have already been invested in OBOR, with several more trillions due to be invested over the next decade. This way Beijing hopes to find a more profitable avenue for the country's vast foreign exchange reserves, mostly invested in low-interest-bearing US government securities.

It is evident that OBOR is not just about infrastructure development; one of the major objectives of the initiative is to turn Eurasia into an economic and trading centre, breaking the domination of the American-led transatlantic regime. It is also a manifestation of the changing geopolitics and the realignment of forces, reflecting a move to shift the centre of gravity of trade to the East and establish China's predominance in global politics.

Indeed, Russia has lent active support to the Chinese initiative indicating a growing strategic partnership between the two countries. Moscow's major interest is to consolidate its primacy in Central Asia through regional security and a trade bloc.

However, it is willing to accommodate China's economic and geopolitical interests more than ever because of Western sanctions following the Ukraine crisis. Since 2014, the two countries have reached several high-profile multibillion-dollar economic and trade deals signalling their close, evolving economic ties. Unsurprisingly, Russian President Vladimir Putin used the forum to lash out at the US and other Western countries over their increasingly protectionist policies.

Surely China considers the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) a 'flagship project' in the whole scheme of OBOR. This multibillion-dollar investment programme has added a new dimension to the friendship between Pakistan and China. From purely strategic and security cooperation spanning more than five decades, the relationship has now evolved into a dynamic economic and commercial partnership.

This growing bilateral cooperation comes at a time when China's rising geopolitical ambition also underscores its concerns about Pakistan's security and its fledgling economy. Given its geostrategic position, Pakistan has the potential to serve as a nexus for the two routes the continental Eurasian Silk Road Economic Belt and a Southeast Asian Maritime Silk Road

Although Beijing downplays geostrategic motivations, CPEC represents an international extension of China's effort to deliver security through economic development. Notwithstanding their growing strategic cooperation, terrorist sanctuaries in Pakistan have remained a major source of worry for the Chinese government. China's security concerns, especially those that arise from its restive region of Xinjiang, and the Islamist militancy threatening Pakistan's stability have also been a strong factor in Beijing's new approach to achieving security through economic development.

This growing Pakistan-China strategic alliance has also exposed the regional geopolitical fault lines. Predictably, India boycotted the Beijing forum citing serious reservations about the project, particularly regarding China-funded development in Gilgit-Baltistan that is linked to the Kashmir dispute. Yet another excuse given by the Indian authorities was that a trans-regional project of this magnitude required wider consultation.

Explore: Is India trying to convince the world China's OBOR plan is secretly colonial?

Despite their geopolitical rivalry and long-standing border dispute, trade between India and China has grown significantly crossing $100bn. But there have been some visible signs of tension between the two most populous nations in the past few years with the strengthening of ties between Washington and New Delhi. India has openly sided with the US and Japan against China over the South China Sea issue.

Indeed, the success of the summit has provoked a strong reaction from Delhi. So much so that some leading commentators have called for tougher action to obstruct the OBOR project. 'Far from this, CPEC (the life and soul of OBOR) threatens India's territorial integrity in a manner unseen since 1962,' Samir Saran, a leading Indian commentator wrote in an op-ed piece.

Notwithstanding the scepticism, OBOR is a new geo-economic reality representing an emerging world order. The process cannot be reversed.

Balochistan Chief Minister Nawab Sanaullah Zehri has said that those involved in the Mastung suicide bombing and killing of innocent labourers in Gwadar will be brought to justice.

At a press conference here on Wednesday evening, he said that a joint investigation team had been constituted to probe the two incidents. He termed the Mastung incident and Gwadar killings a conspiracy against Balochistan.

'Killing of innocent labourers of a road project was against Baloch traditions,' he said, adding that attacking and killing of unarmed people was an act by cowards.

Referring to his visit to China along with the prime minister to attend a conference on One Belt, One Road (OBOR), he said that three financial agreements pertaining to projects in Balochistan had been signed in Beijing.

These included: Gwadar International Airport, Eestbay Expressway, Gwadar port and Gwadar smart safe city master plan. He said that Balochistan would emerge as the major beneficiary of the OBOR projects.

'Balochistan is the only province of the country that had signed several agreements which pertained to development of Balochistan', said the chief minister.

He said that the One Belt, One Road project was important for global trade in which 64 countries participated and the People's Republic of China pledged to invest $124 billion in the coming years. He said the views expressed by the Chinese president about Gwadar Port and its economic and industrial zones are an honour for the people of Balochistan.

He also presented a long list of projects which would be implemented in due course of time making Gwadar one of the most developed cities of the world.

Nawab Zehri recalled that around 12 new schemes had been added in the CPEC, including Quetta Mass Transit Scheme, water supply to Quetta from Pat Feeder and industrial areas at Bostan and Khuzdar in northern and central parts of Balochistan.

Besides expansion of Zhob-Mughal Kot and Nokundi-Mashkhel road, Panjgur Highway would also be a part of CPEC, he added.

The chief minister disclosed that the Chinese experts had prepared the feasibility report of Quetta Mass Transit system from Spenzand to Kuchlak and presented it to the Government of Balochistan for approval.

He said that work on Quetta safe city project would be initiated and tenders for it would be floated soon.

Provincial ministers Nawab Muham­mad Khan Shahwani, Mir Sarfaraz Ahmed Bugti, Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, Rehmat Saleh Baloch, Obaidullah Babat and spokesman for the Balochistan government Anwarul Haq Kakar were also present on the occasion.

ON Sept 11, 2001, I was in Washington DC when the Pentagon was attacked, while in New York, the Twin Towers were destroyed. This May, I found myself again in Washington DC, watching the White House being demolished from within by its latest tenant, President Donald Trump.

It was a tragic sight, not only for millions of rational Americans but for billions of citizens of the Free World whose freedom post-war America pledged to defend and then neglected to protect.

In many ways, President Trump sees himself as an elected Captain Han Solo, determined to fight Star Wars in every galaxy. He is confident of his supreme authority and invincible prowess. Doesn't he have the force of the presidency behind him?

Only someone with limitless confidence would have dared dismiss the head of the FBI, James Comey. Was it because Comey had made an unprecedented disclosure about Hillary Clinton's emails? Now even her Republican adversaries concede it cost her the presidency. Was it because Comey had been 'grandstanding' before a congressional intelligence committee, out-trumping even Trump? Was it because Comey refused to pledge personal loyalty to him during a private dinner for two in the White House? Or was it because Comey tunnelled too close to the sensitive vein of Trump's relationship with Russia and refused to call off his hounds?

Trump sees himself as an elected Han Solo.

Trump's brazenness knows no bounds. He has 'threatened' Comey against leaking tapes of their conversations which both know exist. Trump has derided North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's nuclear ambitions, and then tweeted that he would be 'honoured' to meet him. And only Trump would, the day after firing the head of FBI (which for generations had scared Americans with the warning: 'Reds are under your beds'), receive in the sanctum of his Oval Office the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his 'spymaster' Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

The US press corps bristled at being excluded from the meeting. They were apoplectic after the Russian news agency TASS which had been permitted entry released photographs of the three beaming 'conspirators'. 'They tricked us,' one White House centurion complained. 'That's the problem with the Russians they lie.' President Putin could not have asked for more from his Manchurian candidate.

Russians, though, are not the only masters of this sleight of hand. Pakistanis will remember a similar coup in January 2015, when our DG ISPR instantly uploaded a picture taken in 10 Downing Street when COAS Gen Raheel Sharif met an unsuspecting Prime Minister David Cameron.

In today's world, optics is king. No one knows this better than the media-savvy Donald Trump. 'He who reigns within himself,' Milton wrote, 'and rules passions, desires, and fears is more than a king.' Trump's 'passions, desires and fears' are citizens in his realm, the TV remote his sceptre, the mobile phone his Twitter orb.

If the denizens of Washington's 'swamp' had their way, President Trump would be facing impeachment proceedings already. That is still a possibility. The ongoing investigation by the FBI graded internally as 'significant' into Trump's subterranean dealings with the Russians (which his lawyers admit spread over a decade) may well become Trump's Watergate. Though, like Nixon, Trump will not concede without a fight. He will battle to his last pawn. Trump has no intention of being told: 'You are fired!'

Meanwhile, Trump could do worse than consult Nawaz Sharif on the art of survival. Nawaz Sharif, now into the home stretch of his third tenure as prime minister, has positioned himself so that his re-election in 2018 seems inevitable. By taking a team of senior ministers and all four chief ministers with him to China to laud President Xi Jinping's One Belt, One Road initiative, he has assured himself of continuing Chinese support. His entertainment at Murree of Jindal (an emissary from his Indian counterpart Modi), could not have been done without a discreet nod from the army brass. Does this mean that the two men in Pakistan's civil-military kayak have at last realised that they must paddle in the same direction?

It is a pity that neither Nawaz Sharif nor army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa was in New York to attend the Lahore Literary Festival, held at the Asia Society on May 6. There, on one concentrated Saturday, the LLF organisers compressed Pakistan's culture, literary, musical and artistic talent into one glorious cornucopia, from which flowed mellifluous sessions on 'Fake News', on Lahore's heritage, on 'Populism and the Global Rise of Strongmen', 'Satire and Escapism in Fiction and Beyond', and a memorable finale titled 'Notes from a Raga' featuring two US-based, musically obsessed cancer specialists.

That unforgettable day ended with a qawwali, proving that Pakistanis can not only sing in harmony but work in unison. The LLF NY revealed a glimpse, a tantalising vision of that grace and peace which diminishes Star Wars into petty squabbles.

The Human Rights Commission Pakistan in its latest report has said the higher education in the country is in 'serious crisis' and has discussed the issue of the devolution of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) to the provinces after the 18th Amendment.

'Since, the passage of the 18th amendment in April 2010 and devolution of the education sector to provinces, higher education seems in a serious crisis in the country. Punjab Higher Education Commission and Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association remained at loggerheads throughout the year 2016,' reads the report recently launched in Islamabad.

According to the report, universities in Balochistan have a long list of complaints against the HEC and that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa commission is yet to take shape. Under the 18th Amendment, the provinces are to establish their own education commissions but only Punjab and Sindh have done so in the six years since. Balochistan, KP and Gilgit-Baltistan are yet to make progress in this regard.

The devolution of the HEC has not been addressed yet due to the negligence of the authorities concerned, leading to more and more confusion and a cold war between the federal and provincial HECs.

According to sources, the rules say that the HEC's functions cannot be devolved to the provinces without an amendment in the HEC act.

A few years ago, the federal law ministry in its legal opinion said the formation of Punjab and Sindh HECs was illegal. Meanwhile both the provincial HECs are functioning, with the argument put forward that the functions of the HEC had been devolved and the central commission is only responsible for ensuring the standard of higher education. The Lahore High Court recently allowed the Punjab HEC to appoint vice chancellors in provincial universities.

Talking to Dawn, officials in the education ministry said the six year delay in making the decision is concerning.

'The matter should be resolved once and for all in the interests of students,' an official of the ministry said.

In its report, the HRCP said Pakistan was at the bottom of the QS higher education ranking of 2016-17. The country does not have one university which ranks in the top 500 universities in the world in the Times Higher Education (UK) ranking.

The matter were also taken up in the last meeting of the Council of Common Interest which directed the concerned committee to expedite its process of completing recommendations of the final decision.

THIS is apropos the above-mentioned column (May 15). Ever since the One Belt One Road idea was floated, Pakistan's strategic location has acquired a position that is one of the main pillars of the idea behind OBOR.

In the recently concluded OBOR Summit in Beijing, there was a huge gathering of 126 countries, including 29 high profile delegates, except India, which decided to skip this highly important world gathering. India could not participate, being a 'prisoner' of its own belligerent policies towards China and Pakistan.

In a face-saving effort, India took the stand that, 'no country can accept a project that ignores its core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity,' an obvious reference to CPEC.

Pakistan also claims sovereignty over whole of the area, where India is currently building several hydro-power projects in total violation of the Indus Water Treaty and UNSC resolutions. Kashmir is still recognised as an unresolved dispute between Pakistan and India.

The writer has mentioned a feasible suggestion that India should accept a long-term compromise settlement, which may be acceptable to the other two stake holders, the Kashmiri leadership and Pakistan. By skipping the OBOR summit, India has almost lost the cheapest and shortest routes to Afghanistan, Central Asia, Russia and Europe, besides isolating itself. This can certainly be a great set back to its economy.


 
 

Connecting through CPEC

THE Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing was an international media highlight. Meant to increase international cooperation, the event has triggered debate on the prospects and challenges for nations that may potentially join the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative - a debate that will shape policy opinions in those countries in the coming weeks and months.

The forum was also an important occasion for Pakistan; the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor was highlighted as a flagship project of the larger OBOR initiative. The upcoming summit in Astana of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in June will be another such occasion for Pakistan. Many in Pakistan have already started reviewing CPEC and the Pak-China geo-economic alliance afresh. It seems that Pakistan will remain a key focus in the discourse on regional economic and political affairs and alliances.

In his keynote address at the Belt and Road Forum, President Xi Jinping stressed that OBOR is for economic development and free of any political agenda. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's speech echoed this stance when he invited other countries to join CPEC. These assertions notwithstanding, the strategic aspects of OBOR are still expected to dominate the debate on this forum as well as the upcoming SCO summit, which primarily aims at dealing with common security challenges.

Success requires consensus amongst us and cooperation with our neighbours.

The SCO summit will be significant because India and Pakistan are likely to become full members this year - an interesting development in many ways, particularly in the context of the China-led OBOR initiative. India and Pakistan have divergent positions on OBOR. Pakistan sees CPEC as a flagship project of the Chinese dream of connectivity. India boycotted the Forum in Beijing, failing to conceive of an idea parallel to competing with China. It is not certain if the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers will meet on the sidelines of the SCO summit, but if it happens it will be a major highlight of the event.

OBOR is a non-political development initiative. But when President Xi declares that a peaceful and stable environment is essential for success, it brings strategic questions into the debate. The SCO is not a strategic forum; it was created to respond to non-traditional security threats. Dominated by China and Russia, the SCO scope has expanded to pacify interstate tensions as it has some leverage in Central and South Asia.

The SCO summit will mean different things to different nations. For China, it's another opportunity to take into account the other countries' concerns and interests. India will come with a diplomatic posture compatible with that of a big power, and may try to reduce the deficit of not attending the OBOR forum. India will obviously try to assert diplomatic pressure on Pakistan, and it has specific issues for this purpose. Iran, an observer in the group, will continue lobbying for the full membership, which Russia will support. President Tayyip Erdogan is also willing to have Turkey join the organisation. If he succeeds, it will be another step towards transforming SCO into a strategic alliance.

For Pakistan, the summit in June is another opportunity to capitalise on its geo-economic and political interests by expanding cooperation with SCO states to combat common security threats including the militant Islamic State group and other terrorist outfits. Most importantly, it can showcase CPEC as a joint economic venture to the Central Asian states. In terms of trade cooperation between China and OBOR countries, Pakistan stands among the countries with high potential in terms of trading volume and rapid growth - it should focus on this economic potential.

India and Afghanistan are two major challenges that make it difficult for the country's establishment to put geo-economics ahead of geostrategic considerations. Pakistan's security and political leaderships have offered India the opportunity to join CPEC. Whether or not India responds positively, a debate on CPEC's prospects has already started in India. The leadership of India-held Kashmir also sees CPEC as an opportunity for economic growth and expansion of its markets to Central Asia. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has already stated that CPEC could make the region a hub of emerging economic opportunities. For Pakistan, connectivity with India through CPEC can also help it to make progress on contentious issues, including Kashmir. Afghanistan, being central to Pakistan's future geo-economic prospects, can still be engaged - although it has shown interest in joining CPEC, the full potential of this has yet to be explored. Iran and the Central Asian states can also become part of CPEC, activating a portion of the Silk Route via the Karakoram Highway and railway links, which will require new transit agreements.

For China, CPEC is important for the OBOR initiative. Regional peace with a stable Afghanistan is a prerequisite for its success, which is why it was helping Kabul in the peace process. Although Pakistan cannot guarantee peace in Afghanistan - the country has many destabilising factors other than the Taliban - it can at least extend full support for peace negotiations, which is important for Pakistan's own global image. Pakistan can negotiate joint transit trade agreements with Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and China. It will provide some alternative economic vision to Afghanistan. Once, this was the dream of Afghan president Ashraf Ghani as well, but Pakistan was not a part of it.

For Pakistan, CPEC is important for economic connectivity with South and Central Asia, and the SCO is essential for security connectivity. One cannot ignore the internal dimensions either. CPEC can become an economic development model for OBOR countries, but only if internal consensus remains intact. The government is responsible for chalking out a strategy to keep all of the country's stakeholders on board and make all of the processes transparent. The Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform has to arrange weekly or fortnightly media briefings on developments of CPEC projects, and it would be more productive if such briefings were arranged at different chambers of commerce rather than in the bureaucratic atmosphere of the official secretariats. The government must not ignore the internal front if it wants to maximise the advantages of CPEC at the regional level.

China's One Belt, One Road (OBOR) project will benefit Pakistan and the local business community must take advantage of it, trade representatives told a Chinese delegation during its visit to the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) on Saturday.

A 20-member Chinese delegation - led by Song Zhihui, professor and director of the Pakistan Study Centre at Sichuan University - visited the RCCI to explore business opportunities regarding joint ventures and trade partnerships in construction, building materials, agriculture, transportation, furniture and real estate.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr Song said the Chinese delegation already visited many chambers of commerce in different cities. He said Chinese entrepreneurs are looking for potential partners in Pakistan to start joint ventures in building material, construction, real estate and related sectors.

This will further strengthen bilateral cooperation between China and Pakistan, he said. 'We are happy to see the improved security situation in the country,' he added.

RCCI President Raja Amer Iqbal said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has opened up new horizons for long-term cooperation between the two countries. It is a golden opportunity for Pakistan to revamp and revive its industrial sector, he added. He said Chinese investors should explore doing joint ventures with their Pakistani counterparts, he said.

Mr Iqbal said many sectors, such as real estate, agriculture, construction, building materials, energy and infrastructure development, offer lucrative investment opportunities to foreign investors. He urged Chinese investors to bring technology and machinery to Pakistan and set up industrial units.

He said the RCCI is ready to help Chinese businessmen hold business-to-business (B2B) meetings in Pakistan.

The delegation included China Building Materials Circulation Association CEO Hi Hongwu, Chengdu Farmers Market Association Chairman Wang Shufeng, Chengdu Jiaye Real Estate Development Chairman Dai Desheng, and Rongli State Group General Manager Yang Shengli.


 
 

Shahbaz vows to provide 'enabling environment' to foreign investors

The second two-day international seminar on business opportunities began here on Monday under the theme 'Punjab Means Business' after Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif inaugurated it, pledging that his government would fully facilitate the foreign business community to invest in various sectors in an enabling environment.

'I guarantee you that you will get maximum support. You will never be harassed and you will work in an enabling and conducive environment,' the chief minister said while addressing the conference's participants.

A number of delegates representing various business companies and joint ventures of China, Turkey, Europe and North America attended the first day of the mega event.

While greeting the participants, the chief minister claimed that the first business and investment conference held in November 2015 was successful, as it attracted huge direct foreign investment in Punjab.

Two-day international seminar on business opportunities begins

'Mr Song Taiji, chief executive officer (CEO) of M/s Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Private Limited… is accomplishing the mega project of 1,320-megawatt Sahiwal coal-fired project. He expressed full confidence in the Punjab government in creating an enabling environment for foreign investors,' the CM said.

He said the $1.8 billion Sahiwal coal-based power plant, which is a project of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, had started generating and contributing 660MW to the national grid this month, adding that it would soon be able to add another 660MW within 22 months.

He said that after the Metro Bus project in Lahore, the PML-N-led Punjab government made similar bus projects in Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Multan functional in record time. Recently, a Turkish company agreed to build a 300MW solar power project in Bahawalpur on a lowest tariff.

Organised by the Punjab industry department and Punjab Board of Investment, the conference encompassed various sessions on business opportunities in the province. Lauding China for its special attention towards Pakistan's development, the chief minister said Pakistan was the first recipient and beneficiary of China's One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative devised by President Xi Jinping.

'OBOR starts with the CPEC and Pakistan is its first beneficiary. Under CPEC, various projects have been completed and many are either near completion or under way on fast track,' he claimed.

'OBOR is not limited to Pakistan alone, as it is a message of globalisation for all countries by replacing confrontation with concentration, promoting healthy competition, harmony, prosperity and progress and connectivity through sea, rail and road routes.'

The CM said various CPEC projects were being executed on government-to-government basis that meant that the rules, regulations would of the respective country -- China and Pakistan -- would be enforced.

'We have set a precedent of transparency while implementing these projects. Though the law allows us to award such projects without initiating a bidding process, but we are doing this through a transparent process of tendering. This way, we have succeeded in reducing cost of the project. That is why they (China) are appreciating us, as they believe that the money being spent on CPEC projects by Chinese government will be safe,' he explained.

Shahbaz called for national unity on the country's development and criticised those politicising CPEC.

'Time is running fast. There should be no politics, no grouping, no nepotism and no issue on the development of the country. If this precious time and opportunity is lost, neither the nation nor God will forgive us. Let's pledge for the country's progress and not for personal gains,' the CM concluded.

Earlier, Punjab Finance Minister Ayesha Ghaus Pasha opened the conference, inviting the business community to invest in Punjab that had a major share in the country's 5.3 per cent growth rate.

She said: 'The last business and investment conference held in Lahore in November 2015 resulted in signing of 35 memoranda of understanding between the Punjab government and various foreign firms regarding investment in various sectors. I hope that this event will be more encouraging than the previous one.'

She further said: 'The World Bank in its 2017 report declared Pakistan among the top 10 reformers. And it is all due to our fast growing economy that ranks at sixth fastest with a 5.3pc growth rate.'

World Bank Country Director Patchamuthu Illangovan said: 'Punjab is a land of opportunity that is growing and reforming very fast for the last seven years. Thousands of jobs have been created here. It has a lot of value-added opportunities. The government needs to attract more investment -- both local and foreign -- to boost the economy.'

The two-day summit will showcase a variety of business and investment opportunities in various sectors in Punjab on different bases such as engineering, procurement and construction; build, operate and transfer; public-private partnership from consultancy services to execute the projects. The event will also facilitate investors in getting their firms registered in Pakistan and start their businesses leading to creation of jobs for skilled and unskilled workforce and building their capacity on new technologies.

Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Abdul Basit, Song Taiji, Marek Minkiewics, Attila D. Yerlikaya, Long Ding Bin, Babur Girgin and Shazukang also spoke on the occasion.

CPEC may create more India-Pakistan tension: UN report

The India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir is a matter of concern, according to a United Nations (UN ) report, claiming that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) might create geopolitical tensions with India and ignite political instability.

The report released by the UN 's Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap ) on Tuesday feared that Afghanistan's political instability could limit the potential benefits of transit corridors to population centres near Kabul or Kandahar.

The report, 'The Belt and Road Initiative and the Role of Escap' was prepared at China's request and covers the six economic corridors spanning Asia, Europe and Africa under the umbrella of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

CPEC holds the promise of closer trade, investment and energy cooperation between the two countries, as it creates alternative maritime trade routes for China and its trading partners, it said. According to the report, CPEC could serve as the 'driver for trade and economic integration' between China, Pakistan, Iran, India, Afghanistan and the Central Asian states.

Incensed India

India did not send an official delegation to attend the 'Belt and Road Forum' (OBOR) in Beijing after the Chinese Ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui called on India to join.

Instead, India criticised China's global initiative, warning of an 'unsustainable debt burden' for countries involved.

India is incensed that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ─ one of the key Belt and Road projects ─ passes through Kashmir and Pakistan.

'No country can accept a project that ignores its core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity,' Indian foreign ministry spokesman Gopal Baglay said.

He also warned of the danger of debt. One of the criticisms of the Silk Road plan is that host countries may struggle to pay back loans for huge infrastructure projects being carried out and funded by Chinese companies and banks.

'Connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility to avoid projects that would create an unsustainable debt burden for communities,' Baglay said.

'Shared prosperity'

On the other hand, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif insisted that the CPEC and OBOR initiatives were all about shared prosperity, beginning a new era for humanity and progress in poor regions.

'Work has already begun across Asia and Africa on infrastructure, industrial cooperation and new platforms of technology. Financial flows have found their way to some of the least developed parts of the world. These outcomes are knitting nations and regions into economic networks and inclusive neighbourhoods that transcend borders,' he said while addressing the second session of the Leaders Roundtable at the two-day Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.

He added that the core of the OBOR initiative was connectivity and long-term development, especially in developing countries.

Similarly, China's regional governments are falling over each other to curry favour with President Xi Jinping , jostling for roles in his New Silk Road plan to boost economic and cultural links through Asia to Europe.

One says it wants to send its young people to be Silk Road 'super connectors', while a second is pitching to become a new home for foreign consulates. Another wants to build a folk museum to commemorate Beijing's overseas push.

While official plans published in 2015 only list 18 provinces as areas key to the plan, over 30 of China's territories now say they have an OBOR strategy.


 
 

Opposition terms parliamentary panel on CPEC 'useless'

Oppo­sit­ion members of the Parliam­entary Committee on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) on Thursday registered their strong protest over the role of the committee and termed it a 'useless' body.

Interestingly, only six out of 22 members of the committee attended the meeting held under the chairmanship of Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed.

Leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Shibli Faraz and Asad Umar lodged a protest during the meeting and said the point of view of members of opposition parties were not incorporated in the minutes of the meetings.

'Due to our protest it is for the first time that our statements and points of view have been incorporated in the minutes of the meeting,' Mr Faraz told Dawn after the meeting.

Only six out of 22 members of the committee attend the meeting

He questioned the role of the committee and claimed that it did not follow its mandate and terms of reference under which it was supposed to monitor the CPEC projects, oversee contracts and ensure transparency. 'Fac­ts are being concealed from the nation. The government has to tell the truth,' he added.

Mr Umar said the committee should be wrapped up as it had lost its mandate. 'This committee has no role,' he added.

He asked about the achievements made by the committee, if any. There was no need for such a body, he added.

Talking to Dawn, the chairman of the committee, Mushahid H. Sayed, rejected the claims of PTI leaders and said the committee had done a lot in resolving issues related to the CPEC. 'Last year provincial governments were fighting with the Centre for getting their share in the CPEC. This committee got all contentious issues resolved,' he said.

Recalling what he called achievements of the committee, he said it was because of the body's efforts that controversies over the CPEC's western route had been resolved, Gilgit-Baltistan taken in the loop, Gwadar port made operational, provinces taken on board, the Thar coal power plant made operational and railways system upgraded.

Referring to some controversial road contracts awarded by the National Highway Authority, Mr Sayed said the committee could not go into details of award of contracts. 'I have heard about some wrongdoing in some of these contracts,' he said.

According to an official handout, the meeting was briefed on Special Economic Zones (SEZs) to be established under the CPEC.

Privatisation Commi­ssion chairman Miftah Ismail briefed the committee on the criteria for establishing SEZs as well as setting up such SEZs under the CPEC.

He said that nine locations for SEZs had been declared as priority sites under the CPEC and each province plus the federal area, Gilgit-Baltistan had been allocated SEZs.

'These sites have been identified by the provincial governments and there is close coordination between federal and provincial governments,' he said.

A Chinese delegation will be in Pakistan in the first week of June to visit these sites and discuss their feasibilities. The final decision will be made in consultation between the Chinese and Pakistani sides.

The sites include Rash­akai in Nowshera, Hattar, Sheikhupura, Faisalabad, Bostan near Quetta, Khuzdar, Dhabeji and Keti Bandar plus Gilgit and a federal industrial zone in Islamabad as well as one near Port Qasim.

The parliamentary committee directed the ministry of water and power to carry out wind corridor surveys in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan which are being done and necessary monitoring stations have been established in both provinces.

Earlier the chairman of the committee briefed the meeting about his participation in Belt and Road Forum in Beijing which was held on May 14-15.

The committee welcomed the proactive participation of Pakistan's delegation in the forum led by the prime minister which included the chief ministers of the four provinces.

DETAILS that have emerged about CPEC in a recent story in this paper may have come as a stunning revelation to many, but for those who are familiar with China's One Belt One Road initiative there is little that was not known. Meanwhile, the public reaction from some segments has been paranoiac while the government's has been indignant. Both are unnecessary.

Here is an excerpt from my column 'A Chinese template' in this paper two years ago: '[OBOR] seeks to expand the Chinese economy by first creating mega project construction opportunities for Chinese firms and then by spreading out markets for its manufactured goods. … Long term 'it aims for financial integration with the 65 Belt and Road countries', … [for] removal of 'investment and trade barriers [and] for the creation of a sound business environment in the region.' … 'China will work with countries along the Belt and Road to steadily advance demonstration projects'.'

That Pakistan's main commodities originate in the agriculture (including livestock) sector, the Chinese interest here is not surprising. We have purposely been touting these at investor road shows in world capitals with PowerPoint slides showing how Pakistan ranks amongst the top 10 producers in the world for at least 25 agricultural commodities. Now this is where I'm hearing the most alarm bells ring.

The Chinese have figured that Pakistan's agriculture is characterised by low productivity. They have little to gain from buying out our landholdings for tillage. However, yields can be enhanced substantially and harvest losses minimised by application of modern methods which include demonstration farms, extension techniques, logistic infrastructure and quality inputs. If some of the incremental produce is exported to China or elsewhere then that may not be such a bad thing.

Fears about China's projects are unnecessary.

While there is nothing negative in the Dawn story, which in fact was a factual interpretation of the documents, let me take this opportunity to address some of the other specific fears among segments of the public that in fact predate the story.

After agriculture, the second concern is about jobs and Chinese workers. It should be noted that these are only specialist project workers and most would leave after the work on the power plants, rail and port infrastructure is complete. For Chinese 'going concerns' one only has to look at Chinese mobile operator Zong to see how many Chinese employees it hires.

The third is about visa-free travel. Even if this were to materialise, under our present visa policy, nationals of several countries can obtain visa on arrival in Pakistan. How many do we see lining up to avail this facility?

The fourth concern is around surveillance equipment to build safe city projects and it should be understood that to be meaningful, this would need to be coupled with rapid response by our police forces. Monitoring it from Beijing would serve nobody's purpose.

The fifth is about 'transmission of Chinese culture' through the DTMB infrastructure that is planned to be deployed. PTCL Smart TV already has 100-plus channels. If a couple more are added containing Chinese content then I would be interested to see what effect that may have on current viewer habits or on the ratings of popular channels.

Finally a word about whether this is our plan or China's plan for us:

Shortly after the PML-N government came to power in 2013, I got co-opted on the task force as a private sector member for preparing Pakistan Vision 2025 and the 11th Five Year Plan. By the summer of 2014, Vision 2025 had been given final shape and was widely disseminated to stakeholders and the media. At the third Joint Coordination Com­mittee meeting of CPEC in August of that year, the planning minister had shared it with the Chinese members. At the same meeting the LTP outline was discussed which included CPEC's spatial structure and functional zones, construction of an integrated transport system, IT connectivity, energy cooperation, industries and parks, agriculture development and poverty alleviation, people-to-people communications as well as financial cooperation.

Additionally, the outline contained chapters on financing mechanisms and institutional support measures and implementation framework for the long-term plan. That was in August 2014. How substantively the Pakistani side was able to influence the draft, I cannot say, but I do know this: had this little detail been shared with the public at the time, that we had reached a bilateral understanding with the Chinese on a range of matters, that a long-term plan was now being prepared as a follow up to Vision 2025 and the plan outline had been posted on the Planning Commission's website, the controversies around CPEC could have been avoided.

Pakistan on Saturday reopened the Friendship Gate - the border crossing with Afghanistan in Chaman district of Balochistan - on humanitarian grounds.

The gate was reopened a day ahead of the beginning of Ramazan at the request of Afghan authorities to provide relief to the people living on both sides of the border.

'Pakistan has its area under effective control having pushed back Afghan border police troops. Census has been completed in the Pakistani side of the divided villages,' the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the military, said while announcing the reopening of the crossing.

The crossing was closed on May 5 after Afghan guards fired shells into Pakistan, killing over a dozen people

The border crossing was closed on May 5 when Afghan border security forces fired artillery shells on villages on the Pakistani side of the border, killing over a dozen people.

The villages were attacked while population census was being conducted there.

Afghans were opposed to the census in the villages on the border, many of which are divided.

The reopening happened as a result of negotiations between the two sides.

Sharing the outcome of the parleys, the ISPR said there was an agreement on maintaining ceasefire.

'No border violation will be acceptable and Pakistani troops will maintain their positions along the international border in Killi Luqman and Killi Jahangir on Pakistani side of the border,' it said.

Earlier, Afghanistan had been insisting that Pakistani troops deployed along the border should be withdrawn.

The gate reopened at about 4pm, an official said.

Major Mohsin of the Frontier Corps (FC) opened the lock of the Friendship Gate. Soon afterwards a Pakistani truck carrying Afghan transit trade goods entered Afghan territory through the gate. It was followed by resumption of vehicular traffic between the two countries.

Trucks carrying supplies for US and Nato troops stationed in Afghanistan also crossed over to that country from Chaman.

A large number of Pakistani and Afghan nationals crossed over to the two countries after showing travel documents.

'We are happy with the border reopening as Pakistani businessmen involved in trade, import and export with Afghanistan had suffered losses of millions of rupees due to the border closure,' Musa Jan Nourzai, a leading importer and exporter of Chaman said.

'We have reopened the Friendship Gate on humanitarian grounds in view of difficulties faced by our tribal people and to honour Ramazan,' Sector Commander of North Brig Nadeem Sohail told a tribal jirga in Chaman.

He said that Pakistani traders doing business on both sides of the border were facing difficulties due to closure of the border crossing.

The jirga, held in the FC headquarters, was attended by tribal chiefs and elders, local leaders of political parties and senior officials of the army and administration.

Sources said that the jirga reviewed conditions prevailing at the border and discussed problems being faced by the traders of Chaman running their business on the other side of the border.

Trilateral talks

Pakistan, China and Afghanistan held the first round of their trilateral Practical Cooperation Dialogue in Beijing on Friday.

The senior official level dialogue was co-chaired by Director General of Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mansoor Ahmad Khan, his Chinese counterpart Xiao Qian and Khalid Payenda, director general of Afghan Ministry of Finance.

'The three sides exchanged in-depth views on trilateral cooperation in a friendly atmosphere and agreed to promote practical measures for cooperation,' the Foreign Office said in a statement.

The three sides reaffirmed that their trilateral cooperation was conducive to peace, stability and development of Afghanistan and the region and that it provided an opportunity for benefitting from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. It was, therefore, agreed to advance practical cooperation in different areas to promote mutual benefit and regional economic integration under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Chinese firm gets LoI for Gwadar coal power project

The Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) on Tuesday issued a Letter of Interest (LoI) to China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) for the development of 300-megawatts imported coal-fired power project in Gwadar at a cost of Rs55 billion.

The project is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). PPIB Managing Director Shah Jahan Mirza and CCCC Vice President Xu Jun signed the document.

CCCC will develop the 300MW power project by utilising imported coal in Gwadar.

The company will obtain tariff approval from the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) and start construction after achieving financial close. The project has already been approved by the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) of the CPEC and the PPIB Board.

Gwadar is blessed with a deep-sea, warm-water port, which is considered a crucial link between the ambitious One Belt, One Road and Maritime Silk Road projects.

With the addition of 300MW Gwadar Power Project, the portfolio of power generation projects being processed by PPIB has increased to nine coal-based projects of 8,220MW and three hydro-based projects of 2,714MW, constituting a total of 12 projects of 10,934MW under the CPEC.

The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet allowed the award of Rs55bn worth of 300MW coal power project in Gwadar to a Chinese firm a month ago without bidding at a single-point meeting.

The authorisation was given a special case under Rule 5 of the procurement rules that allowed project award in exceptional circumstances. The rule stated that 'whenever these (Pakistan Procurement Regulatory Authority) rules are in conflict with an obligation of commitment of the federal government arising out an international treaty or an agreement with state or states or any international financial institutions, the provisions of such international treaty or agreement shall prevail to the extent of such conflict'.

Originally, the project was of 600MW capacity, but was reduced to 300MW on the request of the Chinese in November 2014.

At a meeting of the Joint Energy Working Group in August, the Chinese government nominated CCCC, a state-owned entity, to invest in the project and Pakistan readily agreed to oblige. The company requested the PPIB in September 2015 for the development of 300MW plant on imported coal using supercritical technology.

Reports suggest the PPIB put on the record of the ECC that the proposed plant and machinery of the Gwadar project were not of supercritical technology.

The summary to the ECC claimed that in November 2016, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on the power ministry's request desired the ministry and the PPIB to proceed on the earlier application of CCCC for the grant of LoI/letter of support for the project 'after completion of necessary legal formalities as the project was part of the CPEC'.

The government announced in April 2015 the power generation policy. The policy required the project should be covered by bilateral agreements between the government of Pakistan and foreign governments, thus enabling the exemption of pre-award process and procedures, including pre-qualification.

The ECC approved the proposal by the power ministry for authorising the PPIB to proceed with the award of the project to CCCC under Rule 5 of Public Procurement Rules 2004.

Indian industrialists should not be afraid of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and if they want to be a part of it they may formally send a request to our government, Regional Chairman of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Standing Committee Ahmad Jawad said on Thursday.

'We have rejected the Indian notion that CPEC may lead to increase tensions between India and Pakistan. India should realise that CPEC is an economic initiative that is not relevant to disputes over territorial sovereignty,' Mr Jawad said in a statement.

He said the 'One belt, one road' (OBOR) project is expected to surpass $1 trillion which will result in additional benefits to Pakistan.

CPEC is a great achievement of the incumbent government that will help Pakistan increase its income and influence to reduce poverty, he said.

'China should motivate its private sector to invest in industrial projects across Pakistan particularly in the underdeveloped areas,' Mr Jawad added.


 
 

Not so Great Game

THE world has turned upside down. The United States under Donald Trump is rapidly becoming unrecognisable from the country that has been the patron-saint of 'globalisation' since the collapse of the Soviet Union more than 25 years ago. Across the Atlantic, the European Union is in tatters, continuing to reel from Brexit as right-wing xenophobes make inroads into mainstream politics across the continent.

And just to make sure that our cognitive world gets thrown totally into whack: Chinese Premier Xi Jinping announced last month that China would now lead a new 'golden age' of globalisation. The setting was the grandest of grand summits in Beijing to mark the formal launch of the One Belt One Road initiative, through which almost $900 billion of Chinese capital will flood Asian countries over the next couple of decades, mostly to fund roads and other physical infrastructure.

While recent events have appeared to signal immense and sudden shifts in the global political economy, in truth change has been coming for a while. The engine of global production started to shift away from Western countries and towards East Asia as early as the 1990s, while it is also an established fact that the labour flows associated with the era of post-Soviet globalisation have deeply affected the cultural and political make-up of most of the world's countries.

Enmity has cost us a cumulative fortune.

In effect, the US and China have been moving in the direction of swapping global roles long before the current conjuncture, even though political developments like Trump's election indicate that the forces of change are steadily intensifying.

All of this affects Pakistan greatly, given that we count both the US and China as major allies. Unfortunately, Pakistani officialdom seldom scratches beneath the surface of any phenomenon. My sense is that our brightest minds (read: those in power) are almost always focused on where to look for the next wad of cash. In this respect alone, Pakistan's rulers must feel pretty good about themselves right now; on the one hand they continue to garner substantial military aid from Washington and on the other, they are now raking in big bucks from Beijing as well.

Perhaps this euphoria explains why we continue to cultivate enmity with our immediate neighbours. In contrast to shifts in the global political economy, our relations with Iran, Afghanistan and India never seem to change, getting worse with each passing day. Yes, these countries do not offer windfall aid agreements but it can easily be argued that developing mutually beneficial ties with all of them is actually more important than all of the dollars (or yuan) that the two superpowers can offer.

After all, mutual enmity has cost us a cumulative fortune for seven decades and I mean not only in monetary terms, but also with regards to the immense social costs we have incurred by cultivating hate within our own society and criminalising dissent under the guise of foiling 'foreign conspiracies'. But our rulers disagree that friendly relations with Iran, Afghanistan and India are necessary for a peaceful, prosperous future. Certainly, regimes like the Modi sarkar hardly make things easy, but blaming the other side too easily helps us justify our own intransigence.

I may be stating the obvious, but our never-ending tensions with our neighbours indicates we have so deeply internalised the logic of the Great Game that we are now collectively unable to move beyond it. Most readers are familiar with the history of the British and Russian empires jostling for control over southwest and Central Asia from the 18th century onwards. By the 20th century, the US, Soviet Union and China had become the carriers of the Great Game tradition. The US and China today remain the major competitors, with Russia gradually trying to re-establish itself a couple of decades after the USSR's demise.

The northwest of British India later Pakistan and adjacent Afghanistan have been the major staging ground of the Great Game for the best part of its existence. Iran and post-1947 India are therefore implicated by the sheer fact of geography. In principle, the Pakistani state is entitled to use its strategic location to generate rents, as it continues to do in its relations with the US and China. But it also shares the responsibility of maintaining a modicum of peace in the wider region, to the benefit of the region's people.

It boggles the mind, for instance, that the long-talked about Iran-India-Pakistan gas pipeline never got off the ground, even though multilateral donors appeared willing to provide financing for it. Both India and Pakistan have serious energy shortages, so having Iran help address them seems eminently logical. But then what would 'brotherly' Saudi Arabia say? Ah, the perils of the so-called 'greater national interest'.


 
 

America first or America alone?

PRESIDENT Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement offers more opportunities than challenges to the world. Candidate Trump had said that climate change was not for real, that it was a hoax. Now he has invoked economic reasons for his decision but has kept the door ajar, saying that his country will be willing to renegotiate a fairer deal. As his logic of withdrawal from the Paris Agreement has changed, the battlefield for climate action has begun to formally move to other arenas.

The American administration's decision is a major blow to the global consensus that took more than two decades to reach. Except for Nicaragua and Syria - who wanted a greener and more stringent agreement - all countries in the world have agreed through the Paris Agreement on voluntary actions to reduce carbon emissions and stabilise global temperatures at well below two degrees Centigrade.

The Paris Agreement, for all practical purposes, marked the dawn of the new climate economy, characterised by a race for clean and renewable energy. From countries to counties, from megacities to municipalities, and from large corporations to local small and medium enterprises, all have been setting their emissions reduction goals and targets.

Trump is seen largely as operating in a fact-free zone in an attempt to protect the interests of some people.

Subsidies for fossil fuels are under scrutiny. As the world has started moving towards carbon neutral growth, the prices for renewable energy have plummeted to an all-time low, becoming more and more competitive, creating new jobs and thriving service sectors. In developing countries, in addition to fuelling the economy, particularly in Africa and Asia renewable energy started servicing an increasing number of those who previously had little hope of access to clean, reliable and affordable energy.

At the heart of all this is the scientific conviction that faster and inclusive economic growth can and should not be prisoner to fossil fuel consumption - the primary source of global warming and climate change. For the first time since the Industrial Revolution of the 1850s, the rate of increase in emissions has started slowing down, giving hope to vulnerable countries like Pakistan that global temperatures can perhaps, and just perhaps - be stabilised before it is too late for most people on the planet.

No wonder, there is a near universal condemnation of President Trump for his decision. He is seen largely as operating in a fact-free zone and denying science in an attempt to protect the interests of some people in the coal and oil industries, located in the heart of states that voted him in. He has purged climate scientists and deeply cut budgets of climate science institutions such as EPA and Nasa. In fact, it has became so ridiculous that French President Emmanuel Macron has openly invited American climate scientists to come and work in France - reminding the world of the Cold War days when the US used to encourage scientists under communist rule to defect to the West.

The Trump announcement has triggered official withdrawal procedures, a lengthy process that will not conclude until November 2020 - the same month President Trump is up for re-election, ensuring the issue becomes a major topic of debate in the next presidential contest. Yet, it will adversely affect the momentum of change. His unilateral decision will hurt the world but more importantly and more dangerously, it will isolate America, weaken its economy, and shift greater responsibility for action to other countries of the world, even if the US is historically the world's largest emitter.

Never since the Vietnam war has an American policy issue been so divisive. The states of California, Washington and New York that together represent one-fifth of American GDP and one-fifth of American population, announced that they would continue to meet the Paris obligations. A dozen other states are reported to have expressed a similar resolve. The city of Pittsburgh, mentioned by Trump as the city that he represents, (and not Paris), and 500 other cities announced that they are committed to meeting the Paris benchmarks for 2020 and 2030 to benefit from the new climate economy based on clean and renewable energy.

Globally, leading world economies have moved with speed to exercise leadership, as have numerous American and other private-sector companies. China and the European Union have joined hands to uphold their commitments. They have declared that Paris is an essential accord and that climate action is not stoppable. Germany, France and Italy have decided to not leave the door ajar by saying that the accord is non-negotiable, a position that will be taken by most forums that Donald Trump will attend in his tenure ranging from G-7 and G-20 to Nato.

The state of California, Germany and China, have emerged in recent years, as global leaders on clean and renewable energy. In the aftermath of the US decision to quit the accord, these three have a pivotal role to play. Many American states emulate California's Clean Air Act and its thrust for wind and solar energy. Many states will follow Californian standards with or without support from the federal government, and thus share the global burden of emissions reductions.

Likewise, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will have to hold the EU together and further deepen commitments to reduce emissions, including from some of the reluctant EU partners, such as Poland who are finding the transition to clean energy painful.

China has moved with vigour to increase the share of solar and wind energy in its overall energy consumption. It has advanced plans to phase out of coal. Its grand vision of One Belt One Road gives it access to markets in Europe as well as in Africa and Asia. OBOR can serve as a grand clean energy corridor propelling climate compatible development. There is no better starting point for this than CPEC, a prize project of OBOR, that both Pakistan and China showcase and model for future economic partnership in the region.

 China  most likely to establish military base in Pakistan: Pentagon

China will most likely seek to establish a military base in Pakistan, says a Pentagon report, which also notes that despite its closeness to Islamabad Beijing tries to maintain good ties with India as well.

In its annual assessment of China's military capabilities to Congress, the US Defence Department warned on Tuesday that China would build more overseas bases after establishing a facility in the African nation of Djibouti.

The 97-page report 'Military and security developments involving the People's Republic of China, 2017' makes several references to Pakistan and highlights the defence cooperation between Islamabad and Beijing.

'China most likely will seek to establish additional military bases in countries with which it has a longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests, such as Pakistan, and in which there is a precedent for hosting foreign militaries,' the report notes. Pakistan hosted a US listening post near Peshawar from 1959 to 1970 but closed it under Soviet pressure.

But the Pentagon report also says that China's overseas military basing may be constrained by the willingness of countries to support Chinese military presence in one of their ports.

The report notes that as China's regional and international interests grow more complex, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) will also expand its international engagement, especially in the areas of peacekeeping, counterterrorism and joint exercises.

Pentagon points out that in August 2016, Chief of China's Joint Staff Department Fang Fenghui participated in the inaugural meeting of the Quadrilateral Cooperation and Coordination Mechanism, a military counterterrorism pact among Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and Tajikistan. During a March 2016 visit to Afghanistan Mr Fang said that terrorism posed a threat to China's One Belt, One Road Initiative in the South and Central Asian region.

Underlining close defence ties between China and Pakistan, Pentagon notes that in May 2016, a nuclear-powered attack submarine made a port call in Karachi, during a visit by the commander of the Chinese navy. This was China's first port call in South Asia by a nuclear submarine.

'These submarine patrols demonstrate the Chinese navy's emerging capability both to protect China's sea line of communications and to increase China's power projection into the Indian Ocean,' the report adds.

The report points out that from 2011 to 2015, China was the world's fourth largest arms supplier, with more than $20 billion in sales. Of this, $9bn was to Asia-Pacific countries, primarily Pakistan. Sub-Saharan Africa was China's second largest regional arms market. 'China's ability to remain among the world's top five global arms suppliers hinges largely on continued strong sales to Pakistan and demand for its armed UAVs.'

It notes that last year, China signed an agreement with Pakistan for the sale of eight submarines. The first four will be built in China, with the remaining four in Pakistan. Other major Asia-Pacific customers of Chinese military equipment include Bangladesh and Myanmar.


 
 

Govt moves to boost security for Chinese working in Pakistan

Chastened by the militant Islamic State group's claim to have killed two kidnapped Chinese teachers, Pakistan is beefing up security around Chinese citizens streaming into the country on the back of Beijing's Belt and Road infrastructure splurge.

China has often urged Pakistan to improve security after pledging around $57 billion to build power plants, railways and roads that will cross the Himalayas to connect western China to the Arabian Sea port of Gwadar.

Pakistani officials have hinted at extensive security plans that include thousands-strong police protection forces, tighter monitoring of Chinese nationals, and a review of security arrangements in Balochistan - where the two teachers were kidnapped on May 24.

Beijing has been urging Islamabad to improve security for CPEC project

The protection forces will buttress a 15,000-strong army division set up specifically to safeguard projects in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative, which has been credited with rejuvenating Pakistan's $300bn economy.

'We are already alert, but this incident has made us extra vigilant over Chinese security,' said Amin Yousafzai, deputy inspector general of police for Sindh, which is home to about 50 million people.

Sindh is raising a protection unit of about 2,600 police officers to help safeguard 4,000 Chinese working on CPEC projects, and another 1,000 working in other businesses.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which signed billions of dollars in contracts with Chinese companies, is conducting a census of Chinese nationals and raising a force of about 4,200 personnel to protect foreigners.

Balochistan would 'review the whole security arrangement' and Chinese nationals who come in a private capacity would inform the authorities about their activities, said Anwaarul Haq Kakar, spokesman for the provincial government.

The number of militant attacks in Pakistan has fallen sharply in recent years, but violent Islamist groups still pose a threat, and in Balochistan separatists opposed to CPEC also carry out attacks.

The IS killings were a rare attack on Chinese nationals in Pakistan, but the incident has concerned Islamabad and the growing Chinese community.

Miftah Ismail, a state minister involved in the CPEC planning, said Pakistan had devoted huge resources to improving security and Chinese investors should not be put off by a one-off attack.

'The country's security situation has improved,' he said.

The scale of the task facing security agencies is increasing by the day as more Chinese entrepreneurs arrive to set up businesses. Most stay in big cities, but some venture into riskier areas.

The challenge for authorities will increase in 2018, when the corridor is due to become operational and trucks ferrying goods to and from China cross more than 1,000km of road in remote areas of Balochistan areas currently off-limits to foreigners.

Protection force

The Chinese-language teachers were kidnapped by gunmen pretending to be police, but little else is known about how the two ended up in Quetta.

Balochistan's government afterwards evacuated 11 other Chinese nationals based in the city.

'There are no more Chinese living in Quetta.' said Ahsan Mehboob, Balochistan's inspector general of police. It was not clear why the 11 were there.

The new Sindh and KP forces resemble the Special Protection Unit (SPU) recently established by Punjab which has attracted most Chinese investment.

KP was already working on plans to set up the force, but after the Quetta kidnappings the process was 'accelerated', according to one regional official. Sindh was also planning to set up a force before the Quetta attack, and was now expanding it, another official said.

Punjab's SPU, dedicated to protecting Chinese nationals and other foreigners, has more than 6,000 personnel and is set to grow to 10,000.

Raja Jahangir, Punjab's secretary for information, said the SPU chiefs held daily meetings with intelligence agencies and police chiefs to ensure Chinese nationals stay safe, while a database had been set up to track foreigners from their arrival, to their hotels and their departure.

Mr Jahangir said security had been stepped up since the Quetta attacks.

'Almost all personnel are on alert and they are on their toes,' he said.


 
 

Need for timely implementation of CPEC projects stressed

Senior officials associated with China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have called for enhanced security measures for timely completion and implementation of projects.

'Effective and timely implementation of CPEC projects is crucial … the importance of internal security environment, especially in areas where CPEC projects are being undertaken is of paramount importance,' Planning Division Secretary Shoaib Siddiqi said at a conference organised by the Strategic Vision Institute (SVI) during the inauguration of China Studies Centre.

Meanwhile, CPEC Project Director Hassan Daud Butt called for 'doubling the efforts to eradicate terrorism'.

The government has already set up a Special Security Division (SSD) comprising 15,000 personnel from Army and civilian law enforcement agencies for the safety and security of the projects.

The SSD has deployed its personnel on four projects in Punjab and seven in Sindh, in addition to Gwadar which in fact has, to some extent, addressed the Chinese government's security concerns.

However, killing of labourers working on road projects and the reported slaying of a Chinese couple in Balochistan, and most recently the martyring of two Navy personnel in an ambush in Jiwani has renewed security fears.

Meanwhile, Pakistan and China who have been cooperating on the security issue are jointly investigating the killing of the Chinese couple, which otherwise has been claimed by the self-styled militant Islamic State group.

Chinese Deputy Chief of Mission Zhao Lijian did not speak about the terrorism threat but praised the CPEC as the 'fastest and most effective project under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)'. Some 19 early harvest projects worth $18.5 billion were making smooth progress, he added.

Mr Zhao said that out of the two units of 1320MW Sahiwal Coal-Fired Power Plant, the second 660MW unit had completed the test-run and would soon become operational, while the first unit was already inaugurated by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif last month. Another such plant in Port Qasim is expected to be completed this year.

Mr Zhao further said that the bidding process of the Eastbay Expressway project, linking Gwadar port with the network of the main National Highway, was in the final stages and its groundbreaking was expected to be performed by the end of the year. Besides, work on Gwadar International Airport would also commence this year, he said.

The Grant Agreement on Gwadar Airport and Framework Accord on Eastbay Expressway were signed during Nawaz Sharif's visit to China last month.

President, Strategic Vision Institute, Dr Zafar Iqbal Cheema said that China was not only playing an important role in the development and security of Pakistan, but also had an important influence in the entire region and beyond. He said the CPEC was an unparalleled plan for the development, regional connectivity, industrialisation and infrastructure development.

Introducing the think-tank's China Studies Centre, Dr Cheema said, it would endeavour to study Pakistan-China relations, role of China in South Asia and beyond, besides carrying out an in-depth research on security, economic, development, political aspects of the BRI and the CPEC and its impact on regional integration.

President Mamnoon Hussain has urged the National Defence University (NDU) to play an effective role as a think tank to develop a new strategic doctrine in view of future challenges the country could face as a part of the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) plan and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Speaking at the 16th convocation ceremony of the National Security and War Course at the NDU on Wednesday, he said: 'The concept of One Belt, One Road has laid the foundation for far-reaching changes in the world after which a new strategic doctrine will be inevitable in the region and the NDU will play an important role as a defence think tank in this regard.'

National Security Advi­ser retired Lt Gen Nasser Janjua was present on the occasion, as well as several senior officers from the armed forces and state institutions, and 42 senior officers from 23 friendly countries who had participated in the course.

Addressing the audience, the president said the CPEC and the One Belt, One Road plan had laid the foundations for far-reaching chan­g­es in the world, which would also have significant impact on matters of defence.

'With progress on these projects, there will also be changes in the region's strategic realities, thus a new strategic doctrine will be inevitable,' he said.

The president added that the emergence of new trends of extremism and terrorism in the last three decades had increased challenges for Pakistan, which would have to remain in a constant state of war in order to tackle them. 'In difficult circumstances, the Pakistani nation and its state institutions have succeeded in this trial,' he added.

IN recent months, several insightful analyses have been written about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), raising pertinent questions about the lack of transparency around Chinese investments. This being Pakistan, questions were also raised about the patriotism and loyalty of those raising valid issues. An op-ed by a minister went so far as to claim that 'China has never invaded any country nor harboured any imperial designs'.

The truth is that like any nation with a deep history, China has had numerous imperial successes and failures. Sir Halford Mackinder recognised this fact, albeit in racist terms, in his 1904 article 'The Geogra­phical Pivot of History'. Mackinder posited that if China were to combine its oceanic access with an ability to dominate its western land mass, it could be 'the yellow peril to the world's freedom' in the modern era.

We can cast aside Mackinder's racism but the fact is that the Chinese-led Belt and Road initiative, with a focus on the country's periphery and a total investment outlay of $1.4 trillion, is going to transform China into a great land and sea power.

Chinese interests in CPEC are not benign.

For the clear majority of its history, China has stood at the top of the international pecking order. States beyond the Chinese realm were expected by imperial Chinese rulers to acknowledge China's cultural, political and military superiority. While China did not always rely on military dominance to maintain superiority, the country's experience in the 19th and 20th centuries has led elites to conclude their country must, at the very least, maintain political and military equality with other great powers in the 21st century.

Historically speaking, social chaos and internal fragmentation in China has been accompanied by foreign aggression and intervention. This has led to a belief that a strong, centralised government not only prevents internal chaos but allows China to deter foreign aggression while dominating and influencing other nations on its periphery.

To achieve this, China has historically relied on developing client-patron relations with periphery states, resulting in a pragmatic and benevolent relationship between China and its client states. Even during periods of turbulence, these client states continued to show symbolic respect to Chinese superiority.

China has followed this pattern in expanding its influence with neighbouring states such as Pakistan, where there is broad domestic support for China. CPEC is promoted as a gesture of Chinese benevolence to a strategic and special friend.

Chinese interests in CPEC, however, are not benign and are a critical part of China's emerging grand strategy. These interests are fuelled by China's imminent need to secure its global energy and food supplies. CPEC and Gwadar are key to this as they will enable the flow of vital energy and food supplies into China through an alternative route while allowing China to have a military and naval presence close to American military assets located in the Gulf. Recent reports suggesting that China may soon establish a naval base in Gwadar indicate that this strategy is in full motion.

A more visible and expanded role by Chinese diplomats in Afghanistan is also part of this strategy as a stable Afghanistan will not only reduce American military presence in the region, but also unlock energy and mineral assets in the landlocked country. The direct outcome of this can be a more confrontational approach with the US in the region like what we have seen in the South China Sea, where the development of artificial islands is already leading to hostility with America.

It is true that the pro-China view within both elite and non-elite circles in Pakistan make this a truly unique relationship. Having said that, Pakistanis have historically not responded well to the development of foreign bases in their country and a Chinese military presence in the country could lead to a decline in China's standing in Pakistan.

States such as South Korea offer a lesson in how China can use its outsized influence to hurt nations who do not toe the line. The placement of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence in South Korea led to a Chinese backlash against the country, shutting down some of South Korean company Lotte's retail facilities in China, blocking online trade in South Korean goods, and banning all group travel to the country in a bid to hurt its economy.

Pakistan's elites have historically cast aside the opinions and views of their citizens in their bid to punch above their weight in the international arena, leading to negative repercussions in the future. Given the outsized role China is playing in Pakistan's economy, it is important for the government to make Pakistanis aware of what they are signing up for and the leverage China can and will possess in determining Pakistan's domestic and foreign policy positions.

It's  China 's turn

DESPITE billions of dollars spent and diverse efforts made, including multiple military campaigns, political strategies and reconciliation efforts, peace and stability in Afghanistan remain a distant dream. It's more than one and a half decades that the world has been trying to solve the Afghanistan puzzle but in vain. Now China has entered the theatre, probably with a new framework of conflict management.

Rightly or wrongly, Pakistan is considered crucial to achieving peace and stability in Afghanistan. Pakistan, too, does not attempt to dispel the impression, due to some strategic advantages (invisible to ordinary Pakistanis) it sees in Afghanistan. This has strengthened the notion that the passage of peace in Afghanistan passes through Islamabad.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was in Islamabad recently in an attempt to reduce the trust deficit between Afghanistan and Pakistan. While regional security and stability are among the foremost prerequisites for the Chinese connectivity dream of One Belt One Road (OBOR), peace and stability in Afghanistan are also vital for China's internal security. The US would probably welcome any move that shares its burden in Afghanistan, including of failures.

Previously, China avoided playing an assertive role in Afghanistan despite its strong desire to see peace prevail in the country. Though Beijing made a few backchannel efforts to convince the Afghan Taliban to become part of the dialogue process, it avoided taking a lead role in the Quadrilateral Coordination Group that also included the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan. After the quadrilateral peace process broke down, China partnered with Russia to create space for another attempt at peace in Afghanistan. The fate of this initiative remains unclear.

Afghanistan is a test case for China as it assumes a bigger role in resolving regional disputes.

Recently, China has taken a rare and bold diplomatic step and brokered a deal between Pakistan and Afghanistan to normalise their bilateral relationship that is important for any peace initiative in the region. China helped the two countries in the establishment of a bilateral crisis management mechanism to avoid a complete breakdown in communication.

Many see it as a desperate move by China for achieving regional stability. One cannot ignore the fact that the country's growing diplomatic and political stature in the world requires it to assume a more effective role in resolving regional and international disputes. Afghanistan is a test case for China for it entails diverse internal, regional and international conflict dynamics. To start with, removing the deep-seated mistrust between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly when seen in the context of India, would not be an easy task for China.

On the one hand, China and Pakistan are strategic and economic allies in regional and international politics, and on the other, Afghanistan has also signed a strategic partnership agreement with China. But Afghanistan is still far from becoming a functional state. It has also maintained a close association with India, which has thus far not appreciated China-led regional connectivity initiatives including CPEC.

However, it is a big achievement that Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to resume a bilateral normalisation process for which a trilateral - China-Afghanistan-Pakistan - foreign minister-level dialogue forum has been established. The trilateral forum has also asked the Afghan Taliban to join the Afghan reconciliation process.

Reiterating the earlier position of the insurgents, the Taliban head Maulvi Haibatullah Akhundzadah in his annual message demanded the complete evacuation of Nato troops from Afghanistan as a condition for peace talks. It is, however, not known what stance the Taliban adopted in recent backdoor interactions. Even if the Taliban shura has given any indication for peace talks to resume, it would be difficult for them to develop a consensus among their rank and file. The recent surge in terrorist attacks in Afghanistan is also seen as an attempt by anti-talks Taliban commanders to increase pressure on Kabul to such a level that the government itself declines to initiate talks.

There are other impediments too, including the worsening Afghan political crisis, decreasing morale of the Afghan security forces and competing positions of international stakeholders in the peace process. Even as China and Russia are trying to convince Kabul to restart the reconciliation process with the Taliban, the US is preparing a troop surge in Afghanistan which indicates that the new administration is thinking along the lines of defeating the Taliban militarily. Another critical issue is the emerging US-India strategic partnership on regional security issues, which will encourage India to exploit the situation in Afghanistan against Pakistan and even China.

Pakistan's dilemma is that over the decades the world has learned to see the country through the prism of Afghanistan. On the other hand, Pakistan's Arab friends have high expectations from the country mainly in terms of military cooperation. However, they have not taken any initiative to ease Pakistan's diplomatic burden by offering any mediation between the two countries.

Afghanistan and Pakistan both know how to improve their bilateral relationship but sadly they are trapped in a vicious cycle of mutual mistrust. They have huge potential for trade and economic cooperation including regional connectivity through CPEC and routes with Central Asia. At one point in time, the two countries were planning to develop a multilayered security cooperation mechanism, but the forces of status quo did not let it materialise. Both sides have complaints about alleged cross-border terrorist sanctuaries. Failing to achieve bilateral cooperation on border security, Pakistan is investing a lot in border management. But without Afghan cooperation, Pakistan will find it difficult to secure its border with Afghanistan from militants' incursions.

Can China help the two countries develop such cooperation? Pakistan and Afghanistan in the past had discussed prospects for intelligence sharing and mechanisms for border security; some workable modalities were also formed. In the next phase, China may facilitate such cooperation between the two countries. The prospects of joint security operations against terrorists in border regions can also be explored, especially in the context of the capabilities of the Afghan security forces.

The second unit of the total 1,320-MW coal-fired Sahiwal power plant will be opened jointly by Chinese and Pakistani officials today (Monday).

China will be represented by Nuer Baikeli, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), chairman and party secretary of the National Energy Administration, while Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Federal Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal will represent Pakistan.

Earlier, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was scheduled to open the plant but he dropped the plan for unspecified reasons on Sunday. The prime minister had earlier opened its first unit (of 660MW capacity) a couple of months ago. Sahiwal power plant has been completed as a 'priority project' under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

'It is the first large-scale high-efficiency environmentally friendly coal-fired power project built by Huaneng and Ruyi in response to the 'Belt and Road' Initiative,' says an official of the company assigned to commission the plant.

The construction of the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant took 22 months and 8 days, 200 days ahead of the contract period creating 'Sahiwal Speed' in the energy construction of CPEC and costing $1.8 billion. The construction started on July 31, 2015. Until June 8, 2017, both of the two units completed 168 hours full-load test run.


 
 

Modi's American embrace

THE widely circulated picture of Indian Prime Minister Modi clinging to a visibly uncomfortable Donald Trump's breast illustrates the nature of the emerging relationship between India and the US.

Modi's eagerness to serve as America's 'natural partner' to contain a rising China is based on the expectation that this will provide India multiple advantages: latest military equipment and technology; expanded US investment; unconditional US support against Pakistan, a free hand in Kashmir and vigorous endorsement of India's great power ambitions in South Asia, the Indian Ocean and beyond.

The Indo-US alliance has grave security implications for Pakistan. It will exacerbate the military imbalance and make India even more intransigent on Kashmir and belligerent towards Pakistan. Indeed, to deflect attention from its failed oppression of the popular Kashmiri revolt, Modi may feel sufficiently emboldened to actually attempt a cross-LoC 'surgical strike' against Pakistan, provoking a war which is unlikely to remain limited.

However, the alliance with America will involve challenges and costs for India which Modi appears to have discounted.

The US and India are unequal powers. As the practitioner of the Art of the Deal, Trump will not be shy to exercise the leverage which the US will progressively acquire over India, eg, to open India's restrictive trade regime or curtail its traditional ties with Russia and Iran. To sustain the 'partnership', India will have to learn to bend, often, to America's will, compromising the 'independence' of its foreign policy.

The alliance with America will involve challenges and costs for India.

As Pakistan discovered, defence ties with the US can be a mixed blessing. The arms and technology tap can be turned on and off by Washington to secure desired behaviour from its allies and partners. When Lockheed's F-16 production is relocated to India, will the US, as it did with Pakistan, implant software to neutralise the aircraft's operational capabilities in a crisis? New Delhi will never be sure that any equipment it acquires from the US, or Israel, will not be 'compromised' if India attempts to use this for purposes other than those endorsed by the US.

While the US will wish to use India to strategically harass China, it may be more reluctant to support all India's aims against Pakistan and other smaller neighbours. As a 'global' power, the US will want to retain direct influence over Pakistan and other South Asian states rather than delegate this to India.

Undeterred by such considerations, Modi seems to have embarked already on his assigned mission to contain China. India is the only major country to reject China's Belt and Road initiative. It provoked China by inviting the Dalai Lama to disputed Arunachal Pradesh/south Tibet. And, it has blocked Chinese road construction on Chinese territory along the Bhutan-China border. Beijing has demanded the withdrawal of Indian troops 'as soon as possible' and reminded India of the lessons of history, ie India's 1962 defeat.

In his book, Implosion: India's Tryst with Reality, John Eliot argues that India is not well placed to confront China. Although India's GDP is growing annually at seven per cent and China at 6.5pc, the gap is widening since the Chinese economy is more than four times the size of India's.

Given that India has been unable to bully Pakistan, it is hardly in a position to confront China simultaneously. Even the smaller South Asian states are entering into economic and defence relationships with China. The Bangladesh government, although deeply beholden to India, is buying Chinese submarines and will exploit its major Bay of Bengal gas field with a Chinese rather than an Indian partner.

China's Global Times asked: 'With GDP several times higher than that of India, military capabilities that can reach the Indian Ocean and having good relations with India's peripheral nations, coupled with the fact that India's turbulent northern states border China, will Beijing lose to New Delhi?'

India's vulnerabilities are extensive. Kashmir remains India's Achilles heel (where, so far, China has urged Pakistan to exercise restraint). India is fighting 17 'active' insurgencies in 119 districts (according to former prime minister Manmohan Singh), including the Naxalite, Naga and Mizo rebellions, the latter two in areas adjacent to China. With millions of Muslims and 'lower' caste Hindus alienated by BJP-RSS inspired discrimination and violence, India is also fertile ground for civil chaos.

Despite the grave implications of the Indo-US alliance, Pakistan should exercise strategic patience. India is on the wrong side of history. It is building alliances with distant powers, the US and Israel, both of which are disliked by the people if not all Muslim regimes. Pakistan has the opportunity of building strong ties not only with China but also Russia, Iran, and others across Eurasia who will be part of the Belt and Road initiative, which is likely to have a more profound impact on regional peace and prosperity than the US military interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, etc.

Faced with India's growing militarisation, Pakistan's primary objective is to ensure 'full spectrum deterrence' against India. The successful test of the short-range Nasr missile is an important step. Islamabad desperately needs a clear, active, national Kashmir strategy to support and sustain the indigenous Kashmiri freedom movement. There is no longer any downside to raising the Kashmir dispute formally in the UN Security Council and other international forums, including the International Court of Justice.

Despite its imbalanced posture, there is no point in a confrontation with the US. In the immediate future, Pakistan may need to reach tactical 'accommodations' with the US on Afghanistan in exchange for its active support to end Indian-inspired terrorism in Pakistan.

Over time, the 'correlation of forces' in the region will change. India's friendship with Russia and Iran will erode. (Ayatollah Khamanei mentioned Kashmir twice of late). India may blunder into a conflict with China. Its alliance with the US may erode if India proves reluctant to actually confront China, loosen its links to Iran and Russia or to open its market to US trade and investment.

Meanwhile, Pakistan should continue to ask Washington: would not US interests in Asia be better served by cooperation rather than confrontation with China? Do you really want to step into the Thucydides Trap?


 
 

Beijing asked to remove NTBs

Pakistan on Thursday asked China to remove non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and create demand for its goods to make the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC) equally successful for the two countries.

This institutional call came at the National Logistics Cell's two-day CPEC Logistics Inter­national Forum from the Ministry of Commerce and Planning Commission.

On the occasion, the chief guest Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal called for ending the 'game of conspiracies' and allowing Pakistan to grow in an environment of political stability.

The Chinese are in the process of relocating their industry which could go to the Far East or Africa if the environment is not conducive in Pakistan, he said.

Pseudo-intellectuals are spreading misconceptions that Chinese labour force is coming to Pakistan, he said. 'Local labour would be utilised in CPEC projects,' he added.

'It is also incorrect that Pakistan has given tax rebates to the Chinese. In fact, the taxes were in some cases waived on loans repayable by Pakistan to reduce project costs and liabilities,' he explained. Most of the special economic zones would benefit Sindh and Balochistan, he added.

Former advisor to the prime minister on finance Dr Salman Shah suggested the creation of National Integrated Logistic Authority (NILA) for 'handholding the private sector during the initial transition' before private firms become capable of taking over the lead role.

Dr Shah said Pakistan should improve its financial governance, particularly relating to CPEC and reconsider the FTA with China. At the same time, he said the government should also start working on the development of East-West infrastructure in the country.

Mr Shah observed that the much talked about development of Western China, particularly Kashghar has not taken off so far, nor has Gwadar been developed and operationalised. In this scenario, it is difficult to understand the discussions on trucks and border management facilities and what these trucks would carry between Kashghar and Gwadar, he said.

He was of the view that Pakistan should take advantage of China's economy like Turkey benefited from Europe and Mexico from the US.

For that to happen, Pakistan should aim to expand the national economy between $700 billion to $1 trillion, create at least 25 million jobs and secure a minimum of 5 per cent share in China's foreign exports, he said.

This target should be at the centre of our focus if Pakistan wants to take true dividend of the CPEC through joint ventures and common production of goods in China and Pakistan by the same JV firms for its onward supply into global markets, he suggested.

Executive Director General of the Ministry Of Commerce and Planning Commission's Head of CPEC Centre of Excellence Dr Safdar Sohail said seamless supply chain and smooth functioning of ports and border facilities under CPEC is very important. However, Pakistan should focus more on expanding export of services, he added.

At present, Pakistan has one of the highest trade deficits of its history following the FTA with China under which trade flow was heavily in favour of Beijing.

He said China had a narrative of international integration and shared development along the 'One Belt, One Road' and CPEC initiatives but trade integration was very limited. The Pak-China FTA was very shallow and even foreign direct investment envisaged balance of payment challenges, he added.

'China has not made any efforts to facilitate or create demand for Pakistani services and goods. Even its liberalisation did not suit Pakistan,' Dr Sohail noted. He said Pakistan should engage with the Chinese authorities to remove non-trade barriers to Pakistani products and services. For this, openness in China is very crucial, he stressed.

He called upon the Chinese authorities to meet its commitments for creation of additional demand in China for Pakistani exports. At the same time, he said, China should also remove NTBs for Pakistani firms and service operators.

The two countries, he said, should redirect cargo to Gwadar even if it is expensive initially.

He went on to suggest that Pakistan should create more space for public sector logistic operations and give trade, exports and transportation services due focus as part of CPEC.

THE economy of China is the second largest in the world and China is moving fast to become a global power, with a $12trn economy still growing at about 6.5pc annually and three trillion dollars in foreign exchange reserves.

China has also been playing a key role in working for an early entry into the implementation of the Paris agreement on climate change, an important consensus in international development cooperation.

China has been actively promoting the reform of the international financial institutions and it is also an active participant in the establishment of new international economic and financial mechanisms.

However, 2017 is not just another year for China's economic diplomacy as it marks the holding of two major events: the Belt and Road Forum for international cooperation (the BRF) and Brazil, Russia, India and China(BRIC) summit. These events offer opportunities not just for China' own development, but also for the development of other countries and world economy.

Thus, China is marching towards a new era where its economic diplomacy can make remarkable achievements.

NOTWITHSTANDING the pros and cons of the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative in public discourse, the fact is that China will not transfer benefits to Pakistan on a silver platter. These would have to be created and earned by Pakistan and its public and private stakeholders to make the best out of the opportunity.

After all, CPEC is a small part of Chian's 'One Belt, One Road' programme that may last beyond a century and ultimately spread to the entire Eurasian region involving more than five billion people living in more than 100 small and big countries. Traversing tens of thousands of intra-continental kilometres, OBOR is anticipated to create hundreds of new cities on the way and become a corridor of economic power houses.

As such, it would not remain restricted to China and Pakistan but open up to the brutal competitiveness of the entire world and thus follow the principle of survival of the fittest.

CPEC will not remain restricted to China and Pakistan. It will eventually open up to the brutal competitiveness of the entire world and thus follow the principle of survival of the fittest

Therefore, CPEC is going to change the lives and cultures of inhabitants along the route. Border crossings, container codes, logistic services and infrastructure are going to be of uniform standards. That is an area where Pakistan has to focus now with full vigour to match competitors from China, Hong Kong and other areas to grab a fair share out of the enormous opening.

Logistics and related areas have to be upgraded and reformed to support an upcoming ecosystem of regional and international truckers, drivers, hostesses, warehousing, shipping and so on. While the country has around 1,200-1,500 freight forwarding agents and organisations, they are mostly of the subpar quality and obsolete to say the least. They are neither of the required axle load standards nor capable of taking the challenge.

Most of them operate small fleets of trucks and trawlers and do not meet international road standards. The recent revelation that up to 85 per cent oil tanker lorries operating in the country do not meet regulatory standards was just an eye-opener but the required action for their upgrade has been missing.

To be fair, the entire transport management system is so fragmented that it is covered by seven to eight separate federal ministries. Foreign and transit trade matters and standards belong to the commerce ministry; ships and shipping services to the Ministry of Ports and Shipping; airports and aviations to the Ministry of Defence; rails and roads to the Ministry of Communications; trucking, lifters and the likes to Ministry of Industries; rail freight to the Ministry of Railways; and customs affairs and border crossings to the ministries of finance and interior.

No wonder then, the trucking modernisation plan and a national transport policy approved in 2007 has yet to be implemented and we are yet to ratify and adopt international standards and conventions on transport of goods and products. It is estimated that almost 30-35pc of Pakistan's own agricultural produce is currently being wasted because of transportation gaps and almost 2pc of GDP is compromised to logistic network.

It was in this background that Dr Salman Shah, former adviser on finance in the Musharraf administration, proposed last week that a national integrated logistic authority should be created to take forward hardware and software of the transportation and logistics infrastructure chain by hand-holding the private sector for an initial transition before the private firms take over the lead role.

Lessons also need to be learnt from the free trade agreement between Pakistan and China that has now become the major source of Pakistan's trade deficit.

Obviously, the logistic advantage goes to the Chinese operators and Pakistan has to make concerted efforts for a meaningful improvement, not only on logistic facilities but also the products that could go to China, a wishful thinking in the given circumstances.

Pakistan needs a lot to improve from trade terminals upgrade to simplified customs procedures to reducing processing time and better management of expected increase in volumes of traffic alongside modernisation of the trucking industry compatible with international standards, adherence to axle regime and diversified fleet if they have to go deep into China.

For this to achieve, the government needs to engage in a meaningful manner with the logistics industry, listen to their issues, resolve their financing and working capital shortfalls through financial institutions and insurance companies so that truckers, freight forwarders and other related services are facilitated into entering joint venture partnerships with Chinese counterparts.


 
 

S. Asia policy: US team likely to visit Islamabad soon

A US delegation is likely to visit Islamabad in the first week of August to discuss the new US strategy for South Asia with Pakistani officials, says Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed.

The delegation would include officials from the US State Department and the National Security Council, said the lawmaker while addressing a group of mainly Indians and Pakistanis at a Washington think-tank, the Atlantic Council.

On Monday evening, the council's South Asia Centre arranged a conversation between two former information ministers from Pakistan and India Mr Sayed and Manish Tiwari to discuss whether or not 'media diplomacy' could challenge the neighbours' narrative.

Mr Sayed used the opportunity to talk also about the ongoing review of the US strategy for South Asia, praising the Trump administration for its decision to develop a new policy for the entire region, instead of clubbing Pakistan with Afghanistan.

Mushahid Hussain advises India to avoid Cold War-style confrontation

The senator, however, disagreed with Washington's claim that Pakistan was still allowing militants to use 'safe havens' inside its territory for launching attacks into Afghanistan. 'The US wants to scapegoat Pakistan for its failures in Afghanistan,' he said.

His conversation with Mr Tiwari, however, focused on relations between India and Pakistan and both politicians stressed the need for reducing tensions between the two neighbouring states.

Both talked about the warmth that visitors from one country received when visiting the other and urged the media to tap these positive sentiments for improving ties.

Senator Sayed pointed out that South Asia was home to 20 per cent of humanity, which 'needs more interaction, not negativism'.

While Mr Tiwari backed the suggestion to restart cricket matches between India and Pakistan, he said he was not sure if a cricket match between promoted peace or was seen as a mini-war between the two rivals.

Mr Sayed disagreed, citing the June 18 match during which a former Indian captain, Sourav Ganguly, defended the Pakistani team when a former Pakistani Test player attacked it.

Criticising the policies of the Indian government, the senator urged New Delhi to understand that 'size doesn't equal strength; otherwise tiny Cuba couldn't have stood up to the US'.

He also quoted from the Economist magazine, which said that in today's India rising authoritarianism did 'not allow for reasoned debate/discussion/dissent'.

Mr Sayed also asked India to be a part of 'Asian century connectivity rather than the Cold War-style confrontation which has led to troubled ties with neighbours'.

He described China's One Belt, One Road policy as the most important diplomatic and developmental initiative of the 21st century, and urged India to join in, instead of opposing it.

The senator said former US president Barack Obama failed to figure out a Pakistan policy, which created complications in the region. 'We are now waiting to see how President Trump's approach will be better or different,' he said.

The senator said that in India, a new narrative from the ruling party ideologues was being inserted into textbooks by eliminating references to the country's Muslim past.

He said the Indian state's Hindutva ideology was combining Muslim-bashing at home with anti-Pakistan animus, challenging peace and stability in the region. 'Clarity in approach and common ground [are] needed,' he added.

'We as nations should have a strategic stake in each other's economic development backed by the political leaderships,' the senator said, adding that improving ties with India had always been on the political agenda of the Pakistani governments.

Mr Tiwari, a senior Congress leader, asked Pakistan not to blame Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi but their own policy of 'using terrorist groups as proxies for the current tensions between the two countries'.

'The infliction point in India-Pakistan relations was 26/11 [Mumbai attacks]. After 2008, irrespective of the fact that whether there was a UPA government or that was succeeded by a BJP-led NDA government, the relationship with Pakistan has been in a deep freeze,' he said.

'There is a very widespread feeling among the people of India, not limited to the government, that action against the perpetrators of 26/11 is a pre-requisite for forward movement between India and Pakistan.'

Mr Tiwari alleged that when Mr Modi spontaneously decided to land in Lahore to attend wedding of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's granddaughter, the response was a terrorist attack on the Pathankot airbase in India.


 
 

Political developments won't affect ties:  China

China expressed the hope on Friday that its bilateral relations would remain unaffected by political developments in Pakistan and urged Pakistan's political parties to show maturity.

'As a friendly neighbour, China hopes that all parties and sections in Pakistan can prioritise state and national interests, properly deal with their domestic affairs, maintain unity and stability and keep focusing on the economic and social development,' a statement issued by the Chinese embassy, which was attributed to a 'spokesman', said.

China was one of the first countries to express its position on political changes in Pakistan set off by the Supreme Court's verdict in the Panama Papers case, which disqualified Mr Nawaz Sharif as the prime minister.

China has a longstanding relationship with Pakistan, but its stakes here are particularly high because of its large scale investment in multi-billion dollars China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), an infrastructure and communications project.

The statement at the same time said that Mr Nawaz Sharif's ouster was Pakistan's 'internal affair'.

'We believe that the China-Pakistan strategic cooperative partnership will not be affected by the change of the situation inside Pakistan,' the statement said, noting that 'the all-weather friendship between China and Pakistan has withstood the test of times'.

Political changes in the past did not affect relations with China. There has been a national consensus on strategic relations with China.

The statement reaffirmed Beijing's commitment to continue working with Islamabad 'for jointly building the Belt and Road and build a community of shared future, which serves fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples and promotes peace and development of the region and beyond'.

Chief Minister Pervez Khattak has agreed to a proposal for establishing Chinese language centres in Peshawar, Abbottabad, Haripur and Mansehra in the backdrop of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Presiding over the 36th meeting of the board of directors of Frontier Education Foundation at the Chief Minister Secretariat here, Mr Khattak said that in the second phase such centres would be established in the southern districts and Malakand division that would enable the youth to benefit from CPEC and contribute to the process of development in the province.

According to a statement issued here, provincial minister for finance Muzaffar Said, advisor to chief minister on higher education Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani, secretary higher education and others attended the meeting.

The chief minister approved the release of Rs284 million grant to the Frontier Education Foundation. He also approved the upgradation of posts from BPS-16 to BPS-17 to the master's degree holders and scholarships out of the endowment fund. He directed to evolve a strategy to financially support the private colleges in areas where there was shortage of public sector colleges.

Mr Khattak said that the government wanted to promote education in backward areas.

The meeting discussed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa China Economic Cooperation Plan and different strategies, budget estimates of the foundation and future plan for financial help to private educational institutions.

It was told about the student scholarships from different Chinese Universities, adding that 100 scholarships had been arranged in the Shangdong Normal University and the scholars would be sent in September. The scholars have been given 50 per cent concession in tuition and residential fee. In Harbin Engineering University and Shanghai University 100 each scholarships on the same pattern have been given while 40 scholarships are ready in the Tianjin Modern Vocational Technology College for diploma.

It was also added that the belt and road commercial company had also offered vocational, technical and professional training. In this regard, 300 students who got scholarships would be sent to China after a special event this month.

The meeting was told that of the four centres three of Peshawar, Abbottabad and Haripur would be made functional by Aug 10. The chief minister was informed that census of the private education sector would be held in 14 districts of the province in the first phase.


 
 

Natural disasters, security threats impediments to CPEC: Chinese entrepreneur

Despite security threats and natural disasters, (work on) the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will continue to link Pakistan with China and allow smooth exchange of goods between the two countries, said a Chinese entrepreneur on Saturday.

Talking to reporters here, Exim's managing director Tianru Tang cited two major concerns in the construction and maintenance of the Karakorum Highway (KKH) and Khunjerab Pass - geological disasters and adverse security conditions.

Since the highway was located in Gilgit-Baltistan, which was a frequent target of sectarian and terrorist attacks, the construction process was hampered, said Mr Tianru, adding that security situation also risked safety of Chinese personnel.

He lauded the police and security forces for playing their role in maintaining peace in the region.

The key impediment in development, however, was natural disasters, said Mr Tianru.

The KKH is the world's highest cross-boundary road, with bridges over Khunjerab Hunza, Gilgit and Indus rivers, which stretches through the Karakorum, Hindukush and Pamir mountains and the western end of Himalayas.

'This [KKH] area is known as the geological disaster museum owing to frequent natural disasters,' Mr Tianru said.

While the CPEC is a new project, he pointed out, the Chinese commenced infrastructure development in Pakistan in 1966, and since then numerous projects have been initiated by the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) - the builder of the CPEC. The CRBC is involved in various infrastructure development projects in Pakistan, including the KKH Phase II (Havelian-Thakot) project, which is a key initiative of the One Belt, One Road strategy.

The completion of the project is expected to enhance traffic flow in the northern region and promote economic development in remote areas of the country.

Mr Tianru said that the CRBC employed up to 7,815 locals and purchased main construction materials worth $416 million from local firms.


 
 

Learning Chinese chequers

Middle India is clearly chuffed. The prolonged confrontation with China on the Doklam plateau, which is into its third month, has provided the comforting illusion that India can stand up to its large neighbour unlike in 1962 when the Chinese inflicted a humiliating defeat on the country. There have been other confrontations and some skirmishes since then on the disputed border between the countries but for Indians, the 1962 war remains the defining point in relations with a neighbour whom they see as an aggressive bully, fed as they have been this view by analysts appearing on shrill and jingoistic TV channels.

Facts are almost irrelevant in this elevation of the national mood over the current stand-off. In the popular perception, Indian troops have for the first time stopped the Chinese from making yet another incursion into Indian terrain. Few care to know that the Doklam plateau, a disputed patch of land in the eastern Himalayas is in neighbouring Bhutan and that its contours have been under discussion between China and Bhutan for long. Even if some were aware of the ground realities, the geography, history and logistics of this strip make it too confusing to make a material difference. At a height of 3,000 metres, the Doklam plateau is at the junction of Bhutan, China and India's Sikkim border and the latest stand-off erupted in mid-June when India opposed China's attempt to extend a border road in the area. India's worry is that the road would give China greater access to its vulnerable 'chicken's neck', a vital strip that links the Indian mainland to its northeast.

At the expert level though, Doklam is causing anxiety, with some analysts not ruling out the possibility of war. Old China hands in particular are puzzled by Beijing's stubborn insistence on unconditional withdrawal before negotiations can start. Former national security adviser Shivshankar Menon thinks the issue is fraught because China is attempting to change the status quo at the tri-junction. Menon was quoted in a recent interview as saying that even in 2013 both sides were talking in other stand-offs and had returned to earlier positions. What has changed now?

The Doklam stand-off has reset the South Asian strategic board with India's smaller neighbours moving closer to Beijing.

One view is that the Modi government's policy of persistent confrontation and rivalry has annoyed China and made it less willing to negotiate. As to what prompted India to flex its muscle just now, there are several theories. The most plausible is that India sent its troops into Doklam to forestall a final border settlement between Thimphu and Beijing that would have bypassed New Delhi. Lending credence to this is an official document issued by Beijing on Aug 2, which claims that the two have 'reached broad consensus' on delimiting the Bhutan border. The incursion, China believes, is the handiwork of National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, who has been described in official media as 'one of the main schemers behind the current border stand-off'. This will remain a matter of conjecture.

However, China's insistence that the Bhutan accord 'has nothing to do with India' is rather simplistic given India's genuine security concerns. India spends vast amounts to keep Bhutan in its fold - Thimphu gets the lion's share of its foreign aid - and also maintains a permanent military presence in the country. It is unlikely to cede Bhutan to China without a fight, even if its regional hegemony has been seriously undermined. One by one, its small neighbours have become more assertive and put New Delhi on notice that they intend to follow foreign policies that are independent of its diktats. Nepal, which has been most prickly with the Modi regime, has made it clear that China is now a factor in its policy calculation. The ill-considered fuel blockade imposed by the BJP government in a fit of pique over its inability to stop Nepal's new constitution increased the alienation of the Nepalis and practically handed the country on a platter to China. It was immediately thereafter that Kathmandu signed a transit treaty with Beijing.

Now, of course, Nepal leapt several places forward in the strategic game of Chinese chequers that is being played out in South Asia - despite India's belated attempts to make amends. Although Modi rushed his foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj, to Kathmandu with a complete capitulation on the issue of the ethnic Madhesi people, which has been a major sticking point between the two countries, the policy shift came a tad late. If it was hoping to prevent Nepal from seeking an alliance with Beijing the ploy failed. A week after Swaraj's visit, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang practically swept the board as Nepal agreed to boost bilateral cooperation under the framework of China's One Belt, One Road initiative, a project that India is strongly opposed to.

And just as India was revelling in its new-found prowess to keep China at bay, another blow was delivered by Sri Lanka. Colombo handed over a 70 per cent stake in the deep-water port of Hambantota to a Chinese state-owned consortium despite strenuous diplomacy by India to prevent it. Politically and strategically, it is a coup for China. Hambantota will not only extend its influence in Sri Lanka, it will, more significantly, enable the dragon to keep an eye on India's maritime and naval operations in the region.

That is a major setback for India and more so for Modi, who was expected to carry forward his admiration for China - he visited the country no less than five times as Gujarat's chief minister - into a new era of cooperation between Asia's leading powers. Instead, the two have been constantly sniping at each other and now appear on the brink of war.

Modi's short-sighted policies, burdened by animosities of the past, are more dangerous for ignoring the growing asymmetry with China, both in strategic and economic terms. India may still be a fast-growing economy but China's GDP is five times larger, while its defence budget is almost four times bigger. And there is the huge trade imbalance. The BJP's ideological parent, the RSS, which is opposed to a rapprochement with China, thinks it can get even by boycotting Chinese goods. The sad reality is that even the national flags that Modi supporters are fond of waving come from China.

Footprints: northern areas' dilemma

Sitting on a small hill along the Karakoram Highway (KKH) in Passu, Hunza, the Glacier Breeze café is famous for its delicious apricot cake. The only thing that beats it is the fantastic view of Passu the café offers: a small piece of Batura glacier that shines in the sun on the one side and the blue waters of the Hunza River that flow quietly on the other.

The serenity of the place, café owner Ali Ahmed fears, is not going to last very long. The cargo traffic on the narrow KKH is set to pick up upon the completion of the 3,200km trade route connecting Kashgar in China's landlocked western Xinjiang region to Gwadar port in Pakistan's Balochistan under the $57bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative.

'I am glad that my restaurant business will boom once trade along the KKH gains momentum and Chinese tourists start using it to visit Pakistan. But this place and the rest of the Hunza valley may suffer tremendously owing to massive cargo traffic movement on the highway,' sighs the soft-spoken Ahmed, who traces his family's migration from Tajikistan via China to settle in the Gojal region several generations ago.

The corridor will give China shorter access to markets in the Middle East, Europe and Africa through a network of road-, rail- and pipeline-connections under the One Belt One Road plan. The project is also expected to help Pakistan boost its economy through massive Chinese investment in energy, industrial and communication infrastructure. But on the other hand, there are fears in Gilgit-Baltistan that the entire region that connects Pakistan and China will gain nothing out of the initiative.

'I don't know how the CPEC is going to benefit the common people in the region,' Ahmed wonders. 'I'm not sure if the facility of the one-year special permit/pass that allows Gilgit-Baltistan residents visa-free travel to travel and work in Xinjiang will continue once the region opens up for trade. If it is terminated, that will be huge for the local people who regularly go there to work and bring back goods.'

Many others share his concerns, contending that the CPEC project has little to offer to the people of Gilgit-Baltistan. 'What is in this 'corridor' initiative for the people of the region?' asks Azhar Hussain, a trader Dawn met in the border town of Sost. 'Small, local businessmen like us will be chucked out of the competition once the large Chinese and Pakistani companies and traders take full control of the surface trade with China and the customs facility is shifted from Sost to Havelian as planned under the initiative. We will have to first go to Havelian for customs and for getting our shipments released. How is that justified?'

There are some who share Ali Ahmed's optimism that the CPEC will boost tourism in the region, which is considered a tourist paradise with its snow-capped peaks including K2 and Nanga Parbat beautiful lakes, scenic valleys and the world's most dangerous roads.

In the last few years, the area has seen a gush of domestic tourists coming from almost every nook of the country after the remodelling of the KKH from Raikot to Khunjerab Pass. Major hotel chains are planning to expand their footprint in the region, with Serena Hotels already having bought a piece of land in Gilmut for its second hotel in the Hunza valley, and the Hashwani Group said to have acquired a place for its first hotel in Karimabad to take advantage of the growing tourism in the region and in anticipation of influx of the Chinese for trade and pleasure.

Another area of opportunity for the local people after the region opens up for trade is the export of fresh and dried fruit. Miladul Salman, company manager of Karakoram Natural Resources (Pvt) Ltd, exports cherries, apricots and apples to the Middle East. 'The only way we can benefit from CPEC is if we can export fresh fruit like cherries, which are very popular in China, to Xinjiang via the road network. At present, our people take a carton or two as a 'gift' when they travel to Xinjiang for work or business. Apart from that I don't see anything coming out of CPEC for the local economy.'

More tourism and the sale of fruit to China are not enough to satisfy the local people. 'What does CPEC mean for the region and its residents? No one has ever cared to discuss our role in this project. Nor has anyone told us if and how it is going to help us. All we know is that it is going to impact hugely on our environment and our businesses,' argues Ehsan Ali, a lawyer from Gilgit, who claims that people are yet to be compensated for the acquisition of their houses, shops and land by the government for widening the KKH from Attabad Lake to Sost.

'I understand it is a very significant project for both Pakistan and China but what about us? Are we good only for repairing truck tyres and waiting on tourists? Or do we deserve to be engaged as a stakeholder?' Ali asks. 'It is because of us that Pakistan is China's neighbour and friend; we connect the two countries, and yet we are being kept in the dark. Anyone who raises his voice for the rights of Gilgit-Baltistan and its share in the CPEC initiative is picked on and subjected to torture. Why?'


 
 

Chinese 'rigidity' rattles Pakistani businesses

Pakistani businesses find the Chinese too mechanical and rigid to deal with.

Accustomed to a Western business negotiation and partnership style they found the predetermined and strictly limited terms of engagement of our Oriental partners a bit unsettling.

It is not an accident that despite the scope and promise, the private sector's share in projects under the CPEC umbrella is negligible.

Faced with a completely different style of doing business, the private sector finds it difficult to keep its head above water

Naheed Memon, chairperson of the Sindh Board of Investment, told Dawn recently that she expected a significant increase in the participation of the private sector once special economic zones become operational.

Khizar Hayat Gondal, federal secretary for industries, promised to share information but nothing was received till filing of this report. Board of Investment chairman Dr Miftah Ismail, who recently moved his office to Prime Minister House, was too busy to offer comments.

The representatives of the business class blamed the Chinese for the issue. 'China, though not explicitly hostile to private sector participation in CPEC projects, implicitly prefers dealing with the government,' an executive commented.

The four-year track record of progress, since signing of the bilateral deal in July 2013, reflected China's seriousness towards CPEC.

So far 59 projects have been identified (17 in energy, 11 Gwadar, eight infrastructure, two digital, four rail-based transit, six provincial road, port, water, mining, nine special economic zones, and two related to social development).

Of all, four projects in the energy sector are operational, with Sahiwal coal-fired power plant contributing 1,000 megawatts, Sachal wind farm in Jhimpir 50MW, UEP wind farm in Jhimpir 100MW, and HydroChina Dawood wind farm in Gharo 50MW.

The remaining are at different stages of progress monitored closely, according to details available on the dedicated government website.

China clearly appeared determined to push through investment in the agreed projects with or without private companies. It was not ready to wait for private investors to digest the initiative and neither did it seem to have an appetite for private sector tantrums.

For the Pakistani business community, therefore, it was a paradoxical situation. Cognisant of the scale and value of the gigantic investment drive under CPEC, they understand that they can't afford to watch from the sidelines but the challenges of dealing with Chinese investors look insoluble.

'They are both reluctant and keen to enter into joint ventures with the Chinese,' commented an official at the CPEC directorate in Islamabad.

'The government of Pakistan will have to intervene to pave the way for a flow of local private capital and expertise in CPEC-related projects. The Chinese state-owned companies active so far lack the interest and flexibility required to attract private companies,' commented a top government functionary associated with CPEC.

'Weaned on government support and conditioned by a Westernised business culture, hopes for Pakistani tycoons to cut deals with Chinese in the immediate future are dim. The stories circulated by people already in a business relationship with the Chinese did not help either. The perception of bureaucratic bottlenecks in China has deepened during the past four years,' he added.

Talking about joint ventures with the Chinese, business circles mentioned Descon, Gatron and Al-Haj Group as leading the trend in power generation, engineering and the chemical sector. Outside CPEC, the Al-Haj FAW Motors rolled out its first car from their plant at Port Qasim in Karachi this month.

CEO of Engro Powergen and Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company Shamsuddin Sheikh, who is partnering with two Chinese companies - State Power International Mendong and China Machinery Engineering Corporation - was perfectly satisfied with the progress and the relationship.

He did express a desire of a longer term relationship with some premium for experience of working together.

'Yes, business dynamics and the quality of relationship vary with different overseas partners. We have experience working with Japanese, European and US companies. For us the learning graph was steep. In the case of the Chinese, with their narrow focus on the bottom line and separate brief for each project, it is harder to capitalise on investment in trust between business partners,' he commented.

Another businessman commented, 'When China chose Pakistan for a huge investment initiative under the 'One Belt, One Road' plan, it generated euphoria in the business circles. However, just four years later it seems to be giving way to despair. The inability of private Pakistani companies to match Chinese demands has frustrated tycoons.'

The businessmen are said to be approaching the government to mediate business deals with Chinese investors.

'Diplomatically, China's support for Pakistan has been consistent. The sailing might not prove to be as smooth on the economic front under CPEC,' commented an investment officer.

'Last week China did not mince words and responded strongly in defence of Pakistan to President Trump's harsh remarks. When it comes to economic interest its attitude is cold and calculating,' he said.

Other government officers involved in managing affairs related to economic cooperation between the two countries endorsed the view. 'In contrast to the Pakistani stance of bending backward to accommodate the Chinese, their attitude is cut and dry. They dictate terms that promote their own material interest first and foremost.'

Pakistani companies in joint ventures with Chinese reported a lack of warmth in partners. 'Unlike our business partners of the Middle East, the Far Eastern regions, Japan, Europe and America, the Chinese are just keen to complete the project on hand. They don't seem to care about capitalising on subsequent business opportunities unravelled over the course,' an executive told Dawn.

CPEC-level cooperation is new. And while some anxiety on either side is natural, the difficulties are also rooted in political systems. The dynamics of a centralised monolithic government in China are grossly different from a multi-party democratic set-up here.

NON-FICTION: WORLD ORDER OR AMERICAN DOMINANCE?

The political evolution of humankind has led us to the present system of sovereign states, most of which respect human rights and the rule of law, but the interaction of these sovereign states used to be arbitrary and heavily influenced by the power structure. There is no global government or an international executive to maintain peace and order. The world has gone to war several times because of the lack of a centralised government. However, politicians, diplomats and military strategists have devised various tools to ensure peace and security in modern times. These tools, whether conceptual or institutional, lay the foundation of an international order. A World in Disarray: American Foreign Policy and the Crisis of the Old Order by Richard Haass aims to examine the history and evolution of world orders and the prospects for an improved version of the global order.

Haass is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and has served as the senior Middle East adviser to George H.W. Bush, president of the United States between 1989 and 1993. The book is divided into three parts. The first traces the history of world orders up until the Cold War. The second discusses problems faced by the global community in the present times. The third tries to make recommendations for improving the existing world order.

Haass has conveniently ignored the atrocities committed by the dominant powers in the name of maintaining order. Noam Chomsky highlights this problem in his book World Orders: Old and New in these words: 'One revealing example is the standard current interpretation of the campaign of slaughter, torture and destruction that the United States organised and directed in Central America through the 1980s to demolish the popular organisations that were taking shape, in part under Church auspices. These threatened to create a case for functioning democracy, perhaps allowing the people of this miserable region, long in the grip of US power, to gain some control over their lives; therefore, they had to be destroyed.' Whether it is the record of the US in Central America as explained by Chomsky, or the CIA-sponsored toppling of the elected Iranian government of Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953 and re-imposition of monarchy, or the outcome of supporting jihadists in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union and how the policy backfired later on, Haass chooses not to mention such contradictions and does not consider them important enough mistakes for the US to learn from before formulating new policies to establish the World Order 2.0 so much cherished by Haass. Moreover, he does not discuss the mainstream criticism made on international financial institutions and how they can be reformed in his proposed World Order 2.0.

While analysing Sino-American relations, Haass is more concerned about the anti-Soviet sentiment that was prevalent in both countries prior to 1989. It is as if the 'real' common ground has been lost after the demise of the Soviet Union. He is underselling the economic interdependence both countries have today.

A proposal for global governance neglects to account for key factors

The chapter 'Global Gap' plays the significant role of assessing the various challenges being faced by the international community. For example, it discusses the issues of state sovereignty, right of self-determination, doctrine of right to protect, humanitarian interventions and nuclear proliferation in detail. However, issues such as climate change, global health, and most importantly, the role of the World Trade Organisation and International Monetary Fund have only been discussed in passing. This is perhaps because much of the disarray in these areas can be blamed on major powers such as the US, instead of small countries that are an easy target of criticism.

In the chapter 'Regional Realities', Haass briefly discusses every region of the world. He describes both Latin America and Africa as stable or less volatile for international order because, according to him, there are no geopolitics and no threat of nuclear proliferation either. The existence of intra-state conflicts and widespread inequalities both within and across countries has not been considered as a genuine threat to the international order by Haass. It reflects on his viewpoint, according to which the economic problems of ordinary citizens are not serious enough to be discussed in a treatise analysing the world order, although dissatisfaction over economic conditions can lead to violent revolutions.

While discussing the rise of China and resurgence of Russia, Haass states: 'Both Russia and China place an emphasis on their respective 'near abroads': the European countries to its West in Russia's case, the South and East China Seas in the case of China's.' He fails to mention here that the US had similar ambitions in Latin America as well, that were embodied in the Monroe Doctrine enunciated by the American president James Monroe in 1823. The only solution Haass can think of for these Russian and Chinese hegemonic designs is increased vigilantism by the US. He prescribes enhanced military presence for these 'anticipated' transgressions by Russia and China. But what he conveniently ignores is the question of who will safeguard the world against the transgressions of the US. On the one hand, he rejects the idea of unipolarity and even multipolarity and argues for non-polarity, but on the other, he wants the US to take unilateral action against other powers.

An honest proposal for the establishment of any new world order should be made from a neutral viewpoint regarding various competing national interests. However, the proposal by Haass seems to be a rallying call for the US to pursue its national interests in the name of creating a new world order. It has been taken as an assumption that whatever the US government will perceive to be in its national interest will serve the interest of the global community as well. A litmus test was recommended by the old guru of American foreign policy, Henry Kissinger, in his book World Order: 'The vitality of an international order is reflected in the balance it strikes between legitimacy and power and the relative emphasis given to each. Neither aspect is intended to attest change; rather, in combination they seek to ensure that it occurs as a matter of evolution, not a raw contest of wills.' The World Order 2.0 proposed by Haass lacks this balance between legitimacy and power.

The author's prescriptions are more focused on what the US should do and neglects what China should do, even though Chinese actions are becoming more important for the maintenance or creation of a new global order. Major uncertainty lies with China's foreign policy as its economic power grows. Therefore, more thought should have been given to that.

Haass discusses Pakistan as a country supporting terrorists, having weak civilian control, providing sanctuaries to the Afghan Taliban and interfering inside India. This reflects the author's lack of a deeper understanding about this country. He does not mention Pakistan's sustained efforts to eliminate terrorism from its soil, nor does he take into account the recent appreciation of the Pakistani economy by international financial institutions and the future economic prospects of the country in the wake of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and One Belt, One Road initiative.

Haass explains the evolution of the international system briefly and in easy terms, but sometimes this brevity and simplicity is achieved at the cost of ignoring key factors and cardinal personalities that set the course for the future of the international order. For academics, what the book lacks in rigour, it gains in simplicity for the layman. Overall, it is a good read for students of international relations and general readers who are interested in an overview of the global issues we face today. In terms of a neutral stance, however, whatever Haass writes cannot be taken at face value. Immanuel Kant, the great German philosopher, dreamed of a voluntary federation of republics with a strong commitment to non-hostility and transparent domestic and international conduct. Let us hope for the dawn of such an era with the help of a scholar pointing the pathway towards that direction.

MOST discussions and analyses with regard to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have a Pakistan-driven perspective, and rightly so. After all, we have to safeguard our national interests and ensure maximum benefits for the country. These discussions and writings have evoked a lot of interest in China. This article attempts to present a limited cross section of the views articulated by Chinese scholars, academics, companies engaged in CPEC, retired officials and other friends of Pakistan.

My past association with China as the region's chief economist for the World Bank as well as visits to China practically every year since then has allowed me to gather these points of view. This year I also had the privilege of attending two international conferences on CPEC, one in Beijing in March and the second in Shanghai in August and listening to the candid views of the Chinese participants from various sections of the society. The goodwill that Pakistan enjoys among the Chinese is perhaps unparalleled and therefore we have to pay heed to their concerns and suggestions. The gist presented here is a composite sketch of diverse views.

The Chinese have voiced concerns regarding negative CPEC talk, security and red tape.

Under its One Belt One Road Initiative announced in 2013, China is planning to invest more than $1 trillion in 60 countries all over the world to establish six different corridors. The receptivity in other countries to this proposal has been anything but enthusiastic; however, some Chinese friends are puzzled by the sceptical and negative reactions from certain quarters in Pakistan expressed in the media, particularly on social media. This comes to them as a surprise because of the long uninterrupted record of strong bilateral relations between the two countries that were not even affected by changes in political leadership in either country. CPEC is the first project of its kind to foster economic cooperation on a massive scale for building large infrastructural projects in Pakistan.

Although realising that there are some external forces hostile to this initiative, Chinese analysts and participants are concerned about what they see as the misrepresentation of facts by many Pakistanis. It is not obvious to them as to what purpose is served by raising doubts and fears about CPEC in the minds of the Pakistani population. The aspersions being cast on the motives of the Chinese, such as the analogy with the East India Company or Pakistan becoming a satellite of China, are very unnerving: external detractors of CPEC pick up these reports and after bundling them as 'risks' of CPEC to Pakistan, disseminate them widely.

The Chinese argue that the IPPs have been a policy instrument for investment in Pakistan's energy sector for a very long time. When the country was facing serious energy shortages no one else came to Pakistan's rescue and invested in the sector. Now that China has come forward with a planned investment of $35 billion or 70 per cent of the total CPEC allocation under the same policy, questions are being raised.

Had it involved extraction of natural resources from Pakistan for the benefit of the Chinese, this criticism would have been justifiable. On the contrary, the benefits of this investment would be exclusively appropriated by Pakistan's industries and households that would no longer face load-shedding while the country would record a 2pc annual rise in GDP growth.

Chinese state-owned companies, designated by the Chinese government based on their expertise and experience, are executing the projects with loans provided by government-owned banks on concessional terms both in tenor and pricing. In several projects, Chinese and Pakistani companies have entered into joint ventures. The repatriation of profits and debt-servicing in foreign exchange arising out of these obligations would become possible after an increase in the volume of exports as a result of the Chinese-Pakistani joint ventures relocating their industries to the Gwadar Free Economic Zone and the nine industrial zones to be established under CPEC.

In the opinion of some, the negative feelings can have unintended adverse consequences for the personal security of Chinese nationals working on these projects, particularly in some sensitive areas of Balochistan. Some elements unhappy with the Pakistani state and government and possibly acting at the behest of foreign powers hostile to CPEC appear to have created conditions in which the murders and kidnappings of Chinese nationals that were almost non-existent have begun to take place. Our interlocutors were grateful for the new division being raised by the Pakistan Army for protection of the Chinese; but the security risk is raising premiums for relocation to some of the vulnerable areas.

The other area which bothered CPEC's project managers was the red tape and cumbersome decision-making within the Pakistani government. Too many agencies are involved in the clearance and approval process, each one taking its own time. These delays cost them money and disrupt the schedule of activities and completion time table. Power tariffs, according to them, should be reasonable, predictable, sustainable, valid for a multi-year period and not subject to frequent changes. They request that a focal point in the government be established and empowered to secure all approvals and decisions.

The next point raised was to have a high-level joint coordination committee to redress the grievances and complaints of the Chinese companies. The existing joint working groups operate at the government-to-government level but there is no platform available for the Chinese companies or their Pakistani joint venture partners to approach. Continuous federal-provincial-local government coordination is essential to move the projects along till completion. Land acquisition is a provincial local subject and the process takes too much time.

When questioned about the Pakistani private-sector companies partnering with them, the Chinese executives told us that the dearth of qualified and experienced Pakistani entities was an acute problem. Their own cost of production would be lowered if they were able to deploy Pakistani managers, skilled workers, equipment operators and labour as part of their deal with the local companies.

These perceptions may be right or misplaced but we have to investigate and take measures to resolve some of the genuine problems faced by our Chinese partners.


 
 

Govt keen to strike more joint ventures with  China : Pervaiz

The government is keen on having more joint ventures with China as well as becoming a business hub for the Middle East, Central and South Asia, Federal Minister for Commerce and Textile Pervaiz Malik said on Saturday.

He was talking to the media after inaugurating the three-day 18th Textile Asia International Exhibition at the Lahore Expo Centre.

We need more joint ventures for value addition in our products and eventually be able to increase our exports, the minister said.

Pakistan is eyeing to become a leading business hub in Asia

Talking about the expo, Mr Malik said, 'The main benefit of this event is that China has brought its technology here for Pakistani businesspersons. We should understand well that China is the only country that wants to shift its technology to us.'

The exhibition organisers - Ecommerce gateway and the Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (Prgmea) - expect the arrival of as many as 50,000 trade and corporate visitors in the exhibition from Sialkot, Faisalabad, Multan, Gujranwala and Lahore during three days.

'Textile Asia is the largest and most successful event of its kind in the region. Previously, the event provided an effective podium for joint ventures and collaborations among the local textile industry and international entrepreneurs. Some 275 exhibitors from 31 countries displayed more than 339 brands,' said Pregmea Central Chairman Ijaz Khokhar said.

The organisers claim that this is the largest textile and garment machinery show of Pakistan with as many as 600 foreign delegates under one roof.

The participants are showcasing products related to textiles and are keen on joint ventures with Pakistani businessmen on sales, distribution, manufacturing, production, etc in view of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

'The cost of doing business (CODB) continues to increase in China and is almost three-time more than Pakistan. Similarly the cost of raw material and other expenses in China is also increasing gradually, forcing the Chinese businesspersons to think about relocating their textile related industrial units to Pakistan, a country where the CODB, raw materials, etc is much lower,' Ecommerce Gateway Pakistan's Chief Dr Khursheed Nizam said while talking to Dawn.

The Chinese government is instructing its business community to relocate their industry in Pakistan and transfer technology to Pakistani people in view of CPEC, Dr Nizam claimed.

Approximately 600 foreign delegates representing various companies from China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Austria, Czech Republic, UK and USA placed their stalls to showcase their products. More than 48,000 visitors are expected to visit the event during 3 days, according to organisers.

'We are participating in the Lahore exhibition for the first time while earlier in March, we had participated in the event held in Karachi,' said Mr Jiang Chun, a representative of the Changshu Sonnia Home Textile Company Limited and Changsu Qunying Knitting Manufacturers Company Limited.

Talking to Dawn, Mr Chun said, 'We feel Pakistan needs Chinese goods as well as technology. This is a good time for Pakistan, which is also a member of the One Belt, One Road project, to avail this chance in view of CPEC as we are here to render our support in this regard.'


 
 

America's new Afghan war

GIVEN US President Trump's initial opposition to continuing the Afghan war, his new policy - to escalate the US military campaign in Afghanistan and blame Pakistan for the stalemate and threaten it with penalties - represents a serious political setback for Islamabad. After its anticipated angry response, Pakistan's senior diplomats have rightly advocated a continued effort to engage the US and simultaneously develop a regional response to the new US policy.

Islamabad and other regional capitals no doubt realise that America is embarking on a 'new' war in Afghanistan, after its initial 'war of revenge' (2001-2004); 'nation building' ( 2005-2009) and Obama's various combinations of a 'fight, talk, pacify and withdraw' policy. Trump's new policy can be described as 'stay and fight'.

The immediate US goal in Afghanistan is to prop up the pliant Kabul regime militarily and prevent its overthrow by the Afghan Taliban. The US generals, who are driving this policy, know that neither complete victory nor an acceptable political settlement is likely.

The US is no longer interested in a political settlement unless the Afghan Taliban accept America's terms.

The strategic purpose of staying on indefinitely in Afghanistan is not to pacify it but to use it as a base for the promotion of America's broader objectives in the region: one, to impose a 'Pax Indo-Americana' in South Asia, including by securing Pakistan's acceptance of the status quo in Kashmir and severe restraints on Pakistan's nuclear deterrence capability; two, to reverse Iran's ascendancy in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq and neutralise its perceived threat to Israel; and, three, to limit the influence of China and Russia in Afghanistan and its neighbourhood and impede China's ambitious One Belt, One Road initiative including the CPEC project.

The US is clearly no longer interested in a political settlement in Afghanistan unless the Afghan Taliban accepts America's terms. Washington is not asking Pakistan to persuade the Afghan Taliban to agree to talks. It is demanding that Pakistan fight the Afghan Taliban itself and thus make it 'easier' for the US to prevent a Taliban victory and 'stay on' in Afghanistan.

The Americans know full well that almost all the Afghan Taliban fighters are in Afghanistan. Some may try at times to hide in border valleys and forests. Some Taliban leaders cross over to the large refugee camps and Afghan 'neighbourhoods' in and around Pakistani cities. Their periodic presence there has been used in the past by all parties, including the Americans, to facilitate inter-Afghan contacts and dialogue.

If Pakistan were to capture or kill the Afghan Taliban leadership, they are likely to forge an alliance with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and other militants who are attacking Pakistan. This will severely exacerbate Pakistan's security challenges, including from the India- and Kabul-sponsored TTP and Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) militants.

Second, with the elimination of the Afghan Taliban leadership, negotiating an Afghan peace settlement will become virtually impossible. US generals may not mind a never-ending war; but the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan deserve a strategy that leads to peace, not perpetual war.

Third, eliminating the Afghan Taliban, whose political agenda is limited to Afghanistan, will strengthen the extra-territorial terrorist groups in Afghanistan: the militant Islamic State (IS) group (against whom the Afghan Taliban are fighting); Al Qaeda, with whom the Afghan Taliban have renounced past links; and Al Qaeda associates TTP, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) and the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (Etim) which are mainly threatening Afghanistan's neighbours Pakistan, Russia, China and Central Asia. It is for these reasons that these neighbours have opened channels of contact with the Afghan Taliban.

Pakistan's energetic new prime minister has offered intensified counterterrorism cooperation and joint border patrols to the US and Kabul. Pakistan's ongoing programme to fence and closely monitor the border can be effective in preventing cross-border attacks. The US should convince Kabul to support it. Pakistan's cooperation would encompass joint action against IS, Al Qaeda and their associates. Islamabad can undertake further steps to promote dialogue between Kabul and the Afghan Taliban. Naturally, Pakistan would expect reciprocal US and Afghan action against the TTP and BLA safe havens in Afghanistan.

Even if Pakistan were to accommodate the US on Afghanistan, it would not be satisfied. Its demands include calls for action against the pro-Kashmiri groups (Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad) and for acceptance of one-sided constraints on Pakistan's nuclear deterrence capabilities.

Under US pressure, previous Pakistani governments agreed to put the LeT and JeM on the Security Council's 'terrorism' list. Islamabad has outlawed them and seized their assets. The US and India want Pakistan to eliminate the iterations of these organisations and incarcerate their leaders. It would be unwise for Pakistan to accept the onus for putting its 'house in order' and enable India to subvert the legitimate Kashmiri struggle for self-determination and continue its brutal repression in occupied Kashmir.

Pakistan is also unlikely to entertain American demands to halt the development and deployment of short- and long-range nuclear-capable missiles, especially when the US is promoting Indian armament, not disarmament, and is known to have formulated plans to neutralise Pakistan's nuclear deterrence capabilities in a crisis.

Consequently, the proffered engagement with the US is likely to prove infructuous. Pakistan should prepare itself to bear the 'pain' of the threatened US sanctions. It should draw its own 'red lines'. Any sign of weakness will intensify, not ameliorate, US coercion.

The Pakistani foreign minister's consultations with China, Turkey, Iran and Russia will hopefully yield a regional consensus that would be valuable in resisting America's new and aggressive posture. Such a regional consensus could: one, accord highest priority to eliminating IS, Al Qaeda and 'associated' militants TTP, Jamaatul Ahrar, Etim, IMU; two, extend support for a negotiated settlement between Kabul and the Afghan Taliban; three, endorse Pakistan's plan to fence and closely monitor the Pak-Afghan border; and, four, demand strict respect by all, including the US-Nato forces, for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan and other regional states.

Ultimately, as history attests, an external military solution cannot be imposed on the Afghans. Like others, the US will leave the 'graveyard of empires' in ignominy if it does not depart in dignity.

The Bank of China (BoC) has been allowed to commence banking business in the country, said the State Bank on Monday.

This is the second Chinese bank which has been allowed to operate in Pakistan.

Earlier, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) opened two branches in Karachi and Islamabad on May 20, 2011. The ICBC provides various services including corporate finance, investment banking, foreign deposits, project loans, and working capital loans.

'In Pakistan, the BoC aims to provide specialised banking services to serve the financing needs of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) related projects by leveraging on its experience and global technology platform,' said the SBP.

The focus will be on providing financial services for CPEC-related projects

Earlier in May, the State Bank had issued a licence to BoC.

The BoC has complied with the important regulatory and operational requirements necessary to commence banking business in Pakistan.

The BoC is a subsidiary of China Central Huijin, the investment arm of the Government of China.

The BoC is the 4th and 5th largest global bank in terms of tier-1 capital and total assets, respectively. It is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Globally, the footprint of BoC is spread across 50 countries out of which 19 are located across China's One Belt One Road initiative.

'The BoC's entry into Pakistan will not only further strengthen the bilateral relationship of Pakistan and China but will also represent growing confidence of international investors on the country's banking sector and the stable economic outlook,' said the SBP.

Habib Bank Limited is the first Pakistani bank which has recently opened a branch in the industrial city of Urumqi, China.

Increasing bilateral trade requires banking services between the two countries. China is now the biggest trade partner of Pakistan while the trade volume has been increasing rapidly each year.


 
 

Pak-Afghan truth

IN his remarks on the sidelines of the recent UN General Assembly session, President Ashraf Ghani was sharply critical of Pakistan and of alleged militant safe havens there, whose elimination he said was essential to achieving peace in Afghanistan.

In his formal address, he called upon Pakistan to engage his country in a comprehensive dialogue on 'peace, security and regional cooperation leading to prosperity'. The level of sincerity of his statement may have been unclear but the underlying truth was self-evident. Pakistan and Afghanistan needed to talk.

Both have been facing a moment of truth ever since the announcement of President Trump's Afghanistan strategy. To its credit, Pakistan has projected its case well, energised its contacts in the region and held its ground in dealing with Washington.

Already the ice seems to have been broken in relations with the US. And Kabul, too, may have taken note that the road to peace passes through Islamabad. Yet all this does not solve Afghanistan's problems or those of Pakistan. Public relations is not a substitute for policy.

Pakistan and Afghanistan have a tortuous shared history that has left a complicated legacy of a divided ethnicity straddled along a disputed border. They now face serious challenges in the form of extremism and terrorism to which both have contributed. The problems of each are now tied to policies and conditions in the other country. These can only be addressed by fundamentally altered Pakistan-Afghanistan relations which will require serious action. Not just Pakistan, Afghanistan too needs to put its house in order.

Public relations is not a substitute for policy.

Packaged inside Trump's rhetoric and the China-supported BRICS statement have been some harsh truths that Pakistan especially should take note of. The Chinese have long felt a wake-up call was overdue for Pakistan. The message was clear. China would defend Pakistan against US pressure but not necessarily its policies, especially those impacting its own interests. China is invested too heavily in Pakistan, particularly through CPEC, not to be worried about the shadow cast by the militant groups on the stability of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

China recognises the importance of the US role in stabilising Afghanistan and the need for Pakistan to support that role in its own interest and that of China. This is one reason China would like Pakistan to retain its linkages with Washington. Not to mention Pakistan's testy relations with Washington will further embolden India and make its attitude even more hostile towards Pakistan. That would make it still harder for Pakistan to bring about any course correction, and for China to hover over Pakistan-India issues to maintain its relationship with India which is important in its own right.

The spillover of the failed Afghan war has indeed caused horrendous problems for Pakistan. And the US and the Afghans were largely responsible for this failure. But Pakistan ought to admit that it too had contributed to the situation, and not just through Taliban sanctuaries.

Truth is the war's failure was inherent in the situation developing over decades in Afghanistan and in the border areas, as a spin-off of the American-led Afghan Jihad, which merged with the jihadist currents long flowing in Pakistan since Ziaul Haq's Islamisation and the creation of militant outfits.

In the end, it was chaos waiting to happen once this new Afghanistan war started. Arguably, there would have been no Pakistani Taliban had there been no Afghan Taliban.

The most serious national challenge for Pakistan now is its internal security and what is happening next door in Afghanistan. Pakistan and Afghanistan need to reach a shared perception of the Afghan Taliban and how to deal with them - no mean feat.

Only China and the US, the two countries with the most stakes in Afghanistan and Pakistan, can bring them together. China wants a stable Afghanistan and Pakistan for the realisation of its One Belt, One Road vision. And the US is concerned about its national security to which terrorism poses a serious threat.

But the war to deal with that threat has gone horribly wrong. And Pakistan, Washington feels, is not being helpful. Trump has tried intimidation and pressure. To its credit, Pakistan has stood firm making a point that the relationship should serve both countries' interests and not just of one. Having made this clear, Pakistan must reflect and realise that much of what is being asked of it, crudely by the US and subtly by China, may after all be in its own interest too.

CPEC passes through disputed territory: US

The Trump administration has informed Congress that it too believes the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) passes through a disputed territory - originally an India claim aimed at thwarting the development plan.

The $56 billion CPEC passes through Pakistan's northern areas, which India claims is part of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir territory.

'The One Belt, One Road also goes through disputed territory, and I think that in itself shows the vulnerability of trying to establish that sort of a dictate,' US Defence Secretary James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Examine: CPEC and Kashmir issue

Secretary Mattis and Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Joseph Dunford appeared before the Senate and House armed services panel earlier this week to brief US lawmakers on the current situation in the Pak-Afghan region.

Secretary Mattis said the US opposed the One Belt, One Road policy in principle because in a globalised world, there were many belts and many roads, and no one nation should put itself into a position of dictating One Belt, One Road. And it opposed the one going through Pakistan also because it passed through a disputed territory.

The new US position on CPEC will further strain already tense relations between the US and Pakistan, which also opposed the greater role Washington has assigned to India in Afghanistan in a strategy President Trump announced on Aug 21.

'As far as Afghanistan goes, as we try to separate out variables where, in some areas, we work with China, for example, terrorism - I think there are areas where we can work - find common ground with China when it comes to counterterrorism, and we should exercise those areas pretty fully,' said the US defence chief.

'But we should be under no illusions,' he warned. 'There are areas where, also, strategically, we need to confront China where we think it's unproductive - the direction they're going in.'

The Chinese foreign ministry has dismissed United States (US) criticism that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) passes through disputed territory.

The $56 billion project passes through Pakistan's northern areas, which India claims is part of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir territory, reports Dawn.com quoting Economic Times.

Defence Secretary James Mattis told a US Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last week that the One Belt, One Road 'goes through disputed territory, and I think that in itself shows the vulnerability of trying to establish that sort of a dictate'.

The Chinese foreign ministry on Friday told the Press Trust of India: 'We have repeatedly reiterated that the CPEC is an economic cooperation initiative that is not directed against third parties and has nothing to do with territorial sovereignty disputes and does not affect China's principled stance on the Kashmir issue.'

It added that over 70 countries and international organisations, including the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and UN Security Council, have signed cooperation agreements with Beijing on the OBOR initiative and incorporated it into important resolutions.

Pakistan has also dismissed the US reservations over CPEC, asserting that it is a 'development and connectivity project for the betterment of the people in the region and beyond'.

'The international community should [instead] focus on human rights violations and heinous crimes committed by Indian occupation forces in Indian occupied Kashmir,' read a statement issued by the Foreign Office on Saturday.

The new US position on CPEC has put further strain on already tense relations between the US and Pakistan, which also opposed the greater role Washington has assigned to India in Afghanistan in a strategy President Trump announced on Aug 21.


 
 

Taking sides on CPEC

The comments were incendiary and call into question whether even the so-called adults in the administration of US President Donald Trump understand the extent to which their words can cause damage.

The strategic rivalry between the US and China means the latter's Belt and Road initiative is unlikely to be looked on with great approval by any US administration. But US Secretary of Defence James Mattis has controversially waded into the CPEC debate by claiming that the 'One Belt, One Road also goes through disputed territory', an obvious reference to CPEC's route through Gilgit-Baltistan.

The astonishing comment has seemingly aligned the US with India on CPEC and possibly even the Kashmir dispute a potentially shocking development with far-reaching consequences that the Trump administration appears oblivious to.

Indeed, for a US administration that has remained studiously silent about the atrocities by Indian forces in IHK, it is remarkable that a senior official has decided to weigh in on the Kashmir dispute in a manner that blindly supports the Indian position.

When President Trump signalled a South Asia strategy in outlining his Afghan policy earlier in the year, was he really suggesting a plan of pitting India against Pakistan to further US strategic goals in the region? The mere possibility would have disastrous consequences for the region and beyond.

Even from a narrower perspective, Mr Mattis's attack on CPEC is deeply troubling. The corridor's vast potential of helping Pakistan become a trading hub and grow and diversify its economy is universally recognised. For Pakistan, there is an inherent challenge to ensure that CPEC's maximum gains accrue to this country and not to outside investors, workers and communities. But CPEC is an undeniably historic opportunity and represents a commitment to Pakistan that is unrivalled.

So why is Mr Mattis coming down on the wrong side of history and the wrong side of the true interests of the people of Pakistan in trying to tarnish the initiative?

The US has hardly been rushing to Pakistan's economic assistance in recent times. In fact, its officials have routinely threatened to withhold legitimate economic assistance for all manner of perceived offences. Unhappily, there is a history of the US trying to bully Pakistan into staying strictly inside the US orbit of influence.

The Iran-Pakistan pipeline, for example, was opposed by the US at a time of acute gas shortages here simply because the US was then pursuing the economic isolation of Iran. The pipeline ought to have been Pakistan's right to pursue and was in this country's clear strategic interest but the US effectively vetoed it even though it was not apparent that American sanctions at the time necessarily applied to the pipeline.

Now it is CPEC that appears to be in America's cross hairs.


 
 

Motion submitted in Senate to seek govt views on India-US nexus against CPEC

Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, who is head of the parliamentary committee on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), has submitted an adjournment motion in the Senate Secre­tariat seeking the government's point of view on what he called the emerging Indo-American nexus against the economic corridor.

In the motion the senator has termed the recent statement of US Defence Secretary Gen James Mattis that the corridor is passing through disputed territory a clear 'U-turn in Pak-US policy'.

According to the senator, the motion is submitted so that the house could immediately discuss the US defence secretary's statement in which he has opposed the 'One Belt One Road' (OBOR) initiative of China and claimed that the CPEC, which is the flagship and pilot project of the OBOR, is passing through a disputed territory.

The $56 billion CPEC passes through Pakistan's northern areas, which India claims is part of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir territory.

Defence Secretary Mattis told the US Senate Armed Services Committee recently that: 'The One Belt, One Road also goes through disputed territory.'

Senator Sayed said in the motion that: 'Since this is the new pressure on Pakistan by the US and 'U-turn' in Pak-US relations, the government through the Foreign Office should explain emerging Indo-American nexus.'

He questioned what step Pakistan was contemplating to counter these moves detrimental to the national interest.

It is believed that the new US position on CPEC will further strain its already tense relations with Pakistan which also opposes the greater role Washington has assigned to India in Afghanistan in a strategy President Trump announced on Aug 21.

A recent statement of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is also evident of the fact that US-Pakistan relations are tense these days as he has said that the days of Pakistan's dependence on the US to meet its military requirements have ended.

He has said that the new US policy to include India for peace-building in Afghanistan will be detrimental to the region. 'We don't believe that injecting India into the Pakistan-US relationship will help resolve anything, especially in Afghanistan, where we don't see any role for India. India has a relationship with the US, and that is between them and the US,' Mr Abbasi added.


 
 

CPEC shifting gears to industrial parks

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is about to shift gears and enter its next phase as the industrial working group on Special Economic Zones (SEZs) is going to finalise its recommendations on Tuesday and decide which SEZ will begin first.

Towards that end, a team from China International Engineering Consulting Corporation (CIECC) arrived in Karachi and began a round of consultations with provincial authorities as preparation for the final round to be held in Islamabad early next week.

The CIECC is a state-owned consulting firm that will carry the final recommendations from its meetings in Pakistan back to the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC) in Beijing.

The first round of consultations with provincial authorities began in Karachi on Thursday at an event organised by the Sindh Board of Investment at Avari Towers. 'The only missing piece is the right policy to encourage the transfer of industries' from China to the SEZs being built in Pakistan, said Naheed Memon, chair of the board.

Details of the package of incentives that is being finalised with the team from CIECC were not made available during the event. 'The sixth meeting of the Joint Coordination Committee of the CPEC had identified steel, pharmaceuticals and chemicals as the first round of industries to be transferred to Pakistan,' Ms Memon said.

Du Zhenli, director at CIECC and leader of the team visiting Pakistan, said he had come to 'share the experience of development of industrial parks' with his counterparts in Pakistan. CIECC has extensive experience in building industrial parks in China and other countries.

'It is very important to know the vision and situation of Pakistan, and their requirements,' he said in a short interaction with Dawn. 'The investment environment is very important, including soft and hard environment,' he added. He emphasised that different industries have different requirements, and each zone 'must follow its own path'.

The soft environment includes policies as well as a 'good environment for working and living', he said, and underlined that this is particularly important where international cooperation is concerned. The hard environment includes transport, water, energy and other infrastructure.

The event was addressed by Mr Wang Yu, Chinese consul general in Karachi, and the commercial consular from the Chinese consulate, who gave a brief overview of the One Belt One Road vision of China.

Nine SEZs are listed on the CPEC website, which will be built once the recommendations are finalised during this round of consultations.

THE China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is the flagship project of China's One-Belt One Road plan and a game changer for Pakistan. However, from the outset this project has given acute indigestion to India and the United States.

The latter has used every trick to contain China and sustain its superpower status.The US intentions are further strengthened by the recent comments of the US Defence Secretary that the CPEC project is passing through disputed territory.

America's rivalry with China is routinely discussed by analysts who have termed it dangerous for world peace. I remember reading an article on this same issue in Dawn in July 2016 by Mr Munir Akram, titled 'Thucydides Trap.'

The Thucydides Trap is a theory which predicts 'sure war' between existing and emerging superpowers. America has also been silent for a long time over the Indian forces' brutal atrocities in occupied Kashmir.


 
 

Terms of re-engagement

PAKISTAN-US relations have entered a new and tense phase following President Donald Trump's harsh allegations and threats against Pakistan in August and Islamabad's angry response.

Both sides, however, appear inclined to re-engage with each other. The nature of the future relationship will be determined by the terms of such 're-engagement'.

After Pakistan postponed several meetings with US officials, the first encounter was the US-requested meeting between Vice President Mike Pence and Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on the margins of the UN General Assembly last month.

Vice President Pence was circumspect and respectful in this meeting. However, it was clear then, and is clearer now, that the core US position and its demands on Pakistan have not changed. On the contrary, Pakistan's readiness to re-engage with the US, and the visible anxiety among some in Islamabad to do so, appears to have once again emboldened US generals, if not its diplomats, to resume pillorying Pakistan.

Read: Sense returns to Pak-US relations

After his meeting with the Pakistan foreign minister, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson dwelt mainly on Pakistan's intrinsic importance rather than its role in Afghanistan (although his remark about the stability of Pakistan's government indicated an interesting dimension of the encounter). By Khawaja Asif's own account, the interaction with US National Security Adviser Gen H.R. McMaster was more confrontational.

And, even while the Pakistan foreign minister was in Washington, US Chief of Staff Gen Joseph F. Dunford, speaking in the house, accused Pakistan's ISI of 'maintaining connections with terrorist groups' (as if the CIA has never had such links!) and, more significantly, of 'running its own foreign policy'.

Someone has obviously convinced Gen Dunford that there is a gap in the positions of the ISI and other parts of the Pakistan government. This is dangerous, because it could lead the US to take ill-advised actions that could disrupt re-engagement and domestic stability in Pakistan.

Pakistan must not delude itself that its re-engagement will change US strategic goals.

The US defence secretary, testifying to US legislators, said the US would 'make one more try' at changing Pakistan's 'behaviour', but if this does not work, it has more 'powerful options' to coerce compliance. Most of these US 'options' are by now well known, as are Pakistan's likely responses. Deploying these will spell a definitive break in relations.

More revealing was Jim Mattis's assertion that China's Belt and Road initiative ran through 'disputed territory'. The Karakoram Highway has been in existence for over 40 years; it is strange that the US seems to have woken up to its passage through 'disputed territory' only after India's declared opposition to CPEC.

New Delhi must be pleased; while China has expressed its unhappiness. But, most importantly, this comment has no doubt reinforced the suspicion in Pakistan that that the US is part and parcel of an Indian plan to disrupt CPEC, and China's access to the Arabian Sea, by destabilising Pakistan through Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorism and the Baloch Liberation Army insurgency.

This conclusion would lead to two others: one, that America's new desire to stay on indefinitely in Afghanistan is designed primarily to advance its strategic goals in the region against China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan, not to stabilise Afghanistan; and two, that its allegations about Afghan Taliban 'safe havens' in Pakistan are designed mainly to justify future US political and economic actions to destabilise Pakistan and disrupt CPEC.

In this construct, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai's recent suspicions about the rise of the militant Islamic State group in Afghanistan 'under US watch' acquire new significance. Moscow has voiced concern for some time about the danger of IS's extension from Afghanistan to Central Asia and Russia's Caucasus region.

Iran has long alleged that the US 'created' IS in Iraq and Syria. China has been preoccupied by the presence of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement in Afghanistan. All three powers have established contacts with the Afghan Taliban to promote a political settlement in Afghanistan and counter IS and its associates.

Given these questions regarding US objectives, Islamabad would be well advised to define its positions clearly before embarking on a new dialogue with the US.

On Afghanistan, Pakistan's cooperation should be aimed at: one, the elimination of IS and its associates, including the TTP and Jamaatul Ahrar; and two, the promotion of a negotiated political settlement between Kabul and the Afghan Taliban (who will inevitably want a power-sharing agreement and the eventual withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan).

Pakistan must make it clear that it will: oppose any security role for India in Afghanistan. And, while it will act to halt any cross-border attacks from its side, it expects, in turn, that Kabul and the coalition will halt cross-border attacks from Afghanistan.

On India and Kashmir, Pakistan should insist that the US help to halt: India's human rights violations in occupied Kashmir; its ceasefire violations along the Line of Control, and its repeated threats of 'surgical strikes' and 'limited' war against Pakistan. Trump's earlier offer to mediate between Pakistan and India should be revived or the UN activated to do so.

Similarly, on nuclear issues, Pakistan's determination to preserve its nuclear deterrence capability leaves no room for unilateral restraint or concessions. The US should encourage India's acceptance of the reciprocal restraint regime which Pakistan has repeatedly proposed.

'Process' will greatly influence the outcome of the re-engagement. Pakistan should insist on a clear agenda reflecting the objectives and concerns of both sides. Both should undertake to refrain from public accusations and insults.

The talks should be based on the principle of reciprocity. (Unilateral concessions will lead to US demands to 'do more'.) Equivalence must be maintained in the level of interaction. Junior or mid-level US officials should not be received by Pakistan's leaders. It diminishes their importance and weakens Pakistan's negotiating positions.

Finally, Pakistan must not delude itself that its re-engagement will change US strategic objectives and policy.

This will only happen if the US and China reach a global accommodation; or if China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan succeed in promoting a political settlement in Afghanistan; or if the US military and Kabul suffer dramatic defeats, and US public opinion obliges Washington to withdraw from 'the graveyard of empires' and end its longest war.

A senior official in the Sindh government on Monday said the provincial administration was weighing the prospects of investment coming Sindh's way and was aware of the fact that it had to develop its cities on modern lines to attract investment.

'The Sindh government has great plans for future, which will soon be tangible,' said Naheed Memon, chairperson of the Sindh Board of Investment (SBI), while delivering a lecture at the Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) on investment opportunities in Sindh.

She said there were no four- or five-star hotels in Hyderabad, Sukkur and Larkana. Developing resorts in smaller cities and tourist towns was the need of the hour for which the provincial government was making plans.

'There should be some amusement parks in Hyderabad and other cities of Sindh,' she said.

Ms Memon added that resorts would be set up at Keenjhar and Haleji lakes soon.

She said Sindh had been the hub of international business and trade in the past due to its port.

Therefore, she added, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and One Belt One Road schemes would usher in the revival of the Silk Route that would connect Pakistan and China to the world market.

The SBI chairperson further said Pakistan was a country with consumer-based economy where numerous business opportunities were available for small businesses, trades and agriculture sectors, which must be availed by the people of Sindh.

'Today, the only way of survival is to get younger generation of Pakistan involved in domestic trade and business.'

She said mega projects such as CPEC would increase connectivity in the country and resolve problems of energy, communication and transportation.

She said technological developments had changed the shape of businesses and redesigned industries.

'We are living in a changed world, which poses the fundamental question as to how a person can capitalise on the opportunities available to him locally, regionally and internationally.'

Ms Memon said Pakistan needed economic security and prosperity.

She added that the Sindh Enterprise Development Fund (SEDF) encouraged small businesses and trades in Sindh for which the fund provided financial support for around 30 agro-based businesses.

'Those who want to start their own business should contact the SEDF. They will be provided with full support.'

The senior official said about 60 per cent of fruits got damaged in Sindh due to poor knowledge of packaging and storage system.

'This huge wealth could be saved through positive interventions and investment for which we are encouraging people and industries.'

Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor SMIU, said some of the best opportunities were available in business and trade sectors in the country, therefore, young generation should not just look towards public or private jobs.

Tracing the history of SMIU, he said before establishment of the SMI on the plot where it existed today, the place was serving as Qafila Serai where caravans of traders from Afghanistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Balochistan and Iran would stay.

'After the advent of railways from Karachi to Kotri in the initial years of the British Raj, the importance of Qafila Serai came to an end and then Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi purchased the plot from Karachi Municipality to establish Sindh Madressah'.

Earlier, Naheed Memon visited the university's Jinnah Museum and praised the historic articles preserved there.

Minister for Interior and Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal has said that a long-term plan for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will be approved by the Joint Cooperation Council (JCC) at its meeting scheduled for Nov 21 in Islamabad.

The minister announced this while presiding over a meeting held here on Wednesday to review implementation of the ongoing CPEC projects and preparations for the future projects to be made part of the long-term plan.

He directed all the stakeholders and provincial governments to firm up their projects and explore further options of mutual interest to be taken up at 7th JCC meeting.

This is the same long-term plan that Mr Iqbal had said would be finalised during the One Belt, One Road summit in May. When pressed by some media organisations after Dawn had published a report about the plan, he promised that it would be made public once it was finalised. When asked by Dawn on Wednesday night whether or not the plan would be made public following its approval by the JCC in November, the minister said: 'Yes.'

The 51st progress review meeting on CPEC projects was attended by senior officials of line ministries and representatives of provincial governments, Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir and officials of the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad, including chargé d'affaires Zhao Lijian.

Meeting chaired by Ahsan Iqbal informed about obstacles to KCR by Sindh govt

The JCC is the apex decision-making forum on the CPEC that is jointly chaired by the planning and development minister and the vice chairman of National Development and Reform Commission of China.

The meeting was informed about some obstacles to the Karachi Circular Railway project by the Sindh government. Mr Iqbal directed the Ministry of Railways to resolve all outstanding issues relating to the project within a week. The railways ministry was also directed to streamline work on the Mainline One (ML-I) project and finalise its financial arrangements at the earliest.

Reviewing the progress of special economic zones (SEZs), the minister asked the provinces to complete feasibility studies of their respective SEZs by the first week of November in order to get tangible outcomes with respect to industrial cooperation.

The Board of Investment was directed to review the feasibility studies so as to resolve any outstanding issue and ensure uniformity in the development pattern. The board was also advised to undertake reforms for transforming the body into a modern investment agency to meet expectations of foreign investors.

The meeting expressed satisfaction over the recent visit of a Chinese industrial expert group and hoped that their guidance would benefit the provinces and regions.

The minister said that relocation of labour-intensive industry from China would benefit Pakistan to seize opportunities for bolstering the local industry as it would create 85 million jobs.

He said the Chinese side had been asked to fast-track implementation of projects in Gwadar and announced that the prime minister would soon perform the groundbreaking of Gwadar airport and 300MW coal-fired power plant.

Besides the power plant, the electricity transmission and evacuation project for Gwadar was also under implementation to facilitate the entire Makran coastal belt, the meeting was informed.

An official of the Gwadar Development Authority briefed the meeting on fresh water facility projects and said that more than 55 per cent work on pipeline installation had been completed, besides construction of Swad and Shadi Kaur dams.

The minister directed that all efforts be made to accelerate work on the 5MGD (million gallons per day) water desalination plant in Gwadar. He asked the Ministry of Communications to arrange groundbreaking of road projects linking the CPEC western route, including Jhand-Kohat Expressway and dualisation of Indus Highway, from Kohat to Ghambeela.

He called for speeding up the process of three road projects, including KKH (remaining portion), D.I. Khan to Zhob and Khuzdar to Basima, saying that financial agreement on them would be signed at the 7th JCC meeting. He laid emphasis on completing feasibility and other formalities of Gilgit-Shandur-Chitral-Chakdara and Naukundi-Mashkhel-Panjgaur roads coinciding with the JCC meeting.

About the provision of electricity to Gilgit-Baltistan, Mr Iqbal directed the Ministry of Energy to expedite the already identified potential power projects for GB for their approval by the JCC.

Correction: An earlier version of this story said the JCC meet would be held in Beijing. The error is regretted.

After suffering from a series of delays, the long-term plan, or LTP, for the China Pakistan Economic Corridor is now ready for finalisation at the seventh meeting of the Joint Cooperation Committee to be held in Islamabad on Nov 21.

At the last JCC meeting held in December 2016, the plan was discussed and both sides agreed that the 'LTP shall be finalised and approved by March 31, 2017, at the latest' according to the minutes of that discussion. But that date came and went, and we were told that the document was awaiting the signature of the then prime minister who was a bit caught up in his Panama Papers-related entanglements.

Then we were told that the LTP would be finalised during the One Belt, One Road summit held in Beijing in mid May. But the government delegation returned from the summit promising that the plan would be finalised in a couple of weeks.

Since the details of the plan had already been published by Dawn while they were away, we were also promised that immediately upon its finalisation, the full LTP would be made public to dispel some of the anxieties caused by the particulars. Then the trail went cold.

This is the first time we have heard of the plan since then, and Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal has again repeated his commitment to make it public after finalisation. Whatever may have been the reasons for the delay, the fact that we now have a date for finalisation is progress, and the minister must be held to his promise of disclosure.

The LTP is the most detailed long-term plan that has ever been proposed for Pakistan, and its ramifications for the economy are deep and broad.

Contrary to the image of CPEC as an enterprise involving roads and power plants, the LTP shows that the real nature of the engagement with China that is about to begin goes far beyond infrastructure investments and enhanced connectivity.

The real game of CPEC appears to be to prepare the economy, society and culture of Pakistan for a massive influx of Chinese investments and personnel. This could indeed prove to be a positive development, and provide the economy with a boost given the scale of the investments being contemplated.

But the public has a right to know exactly what is being negotiated under this arrangement, and to assess and debate its merits. There can be no two opinions about this.

As soon as the plan is finalised at the next JCC meeting, the clock will start ticking for Mr Iqbal to deliver on his commitment and make a full disclosure of all the contents of the LTP.

A redacted or abbreviated version will not do. Full disclosure is what he promised, and that is what he must ensure.

A SOUTH ASIAN crisis is still brewing after US Secretary Rex Tillerson's speed visits to Afghan­istan, Pakistan and India. The brief encounter in Islamabad confirmed the gulf in Pakistan-US positions.

What the US and India want from Pakistan is impossible for it to deliver.

The US has decided to 'stay on' indefinitely in Afghanistan. It knows it cannot defeat the Afghan Taliban. It is unwilling to accept an equitable political settlement. It wants to utilise Afghanistan as a base to contain China, resist Russia, push back Iran and coerce Pakistan to target the Afghan Taliban, in particular the Haqqanis, in order to make its 'stay' in Afghanistan as 'comfortable' as possible. The US also wants Pakistan to suppress the Kashmiri militants and restrain its nuclear and missile programmes. These latter aims are, of course, fully shared by India.

In his public remarks, Tillerson cloaked US demands in the garb of concern for Pakistan's stability. In fact, Pakistan is most certain to be destabilised if it accepts the US and Indian demands.

In the Zarb-i-Azb and subsequent operations, Pakistan expelled the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani fighters from its soil. Some Taliban leaders periodically cross into Pakistan, Iran and other neighbouring countries. In the past, Washington encouraged Pakistan to maintain contacts with Taliban leaders to promote a political settlement in Afghanistan. Now, however, it wants Pakistan to kill or capture them.

In the crisis unfolding, China could do several things to support Pakistan.

If Pakistan does start doing so, it would produce two outcomes: one, the Afghan Taliban would join the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaatul Ahrar and the militant Islamic State group in perpetrating terrorism against Pakistan; and two, it would foreclose the possibility of a political settlement in Afghanistan since there would be no one left in the insurgency with the authority or stature to negotiate such a settlement. This will prolong Afghanistan's civil war, the suffering of its people and instability in the region.

The consequences of forcibly suppressing the Kashmiri militant groups are similarly predictable. Two of these organisations, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, were placed on the Security Council's terrorism list when the previous government in Islamabad agreed to this under US pressure. But these groups and others, like the Hizbul Mujahideen, enjoy considerable popular support in Pakistan. Military and police action against members of these pro-Kashmiri groups who have not committed any crime will produce a public outcry and possibly a violent reaction and intensify, not restrict, extremism. A programme for deradicalisation of extremist groups through job creation and social reintegration is the best option. This would be easier if India halts its oppression in held Kashmir and agrees to a peaceful resolution of the dispute.

Unfortunately, Pakistan's reasonable concerns fall on deaf ears in Washington and, of course, in New Delhi. Encouraged by US patronage, the Modi government is brutally suppressing the latest revolt of the Kashmiri people. It has also adopted an aggressive posture towards Pakistan: sponsoring anti-Pakistan terrorism from Afghanistan; intensifying ceasefire violations along the Line of Control; and issuing repeated threats of 'surgical strikes', 'limited war' and a 'Cold Start' attack against Pakistan.

Not only has the US not opposed Indian brutality in held Kashmir and aggression and threats against Pakistan, it has itself threatened Pakistan with sanctions, drone strikes and military intervention unless it complies with US demands. American drone strikes appear to be already under way. If Pakistan does not respond to unilateral US strikes, India may feel emboldened to carry out its threats of military incursion. A South Asian conflict could be ignited by miscalculation if not design.

To twist an idiom, it is time for the dragon in the room (China) to make an appearance.

America's new alliance with India, its intention to arm India to the teeth, and its endorsement of New Delhi's aim to kill the Kashmiri freedom movement, are designed to secure India's collaboration to contain China's rising power across Asia. Tillerson made no bones in spelling this out in his CSIS speech before visiting the region.

Likewise, the US decision to 'stay on' in Afghanistan is designed in large measure to restrict China's growing influence in South and Central Asia and, more specifically, to challenge, if not disrupt, President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. Defence Secretary Mattis objected that the Belt and Road passed through 'disputed territory'. Tillerson last week criticised the conditions of Chinese financing for the Belt and Road projects.

So far, China has responded somewhat passively to the US-India strategy. After Trump's Aug 21 speech, the Chinese foreign minister defended Pakistan's counterterrorism credentials. The Chinese foreign ministry refuted Mattis's comment against CPEC. However, given the anti-Chinese genesis of the two-front threat which Pakistan faces today, and China's strategic stake in the success of CPEC, it appears essential that Beijing extend strong political support to its oldest 'strategic partner' and 'do more' to equalise the South Asian equation that is presently tilted against Pakistan.

During all previous Pakistan-India crises, especially the 1965 and 1971 wars, China extended diplomatic, material and military support to Pakistan.

In the crisis now unfolding in South Asia, China could do several things to support Pakistan:

strongly endorse Pakistan and the UN's demand for a negotiated settlement in Afghanistan and help build a regional coalition in favour of such a settlement;

call for a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with international law and denounce India's brutal repression of the Kashmiri people;

oppose all threats of use of force against Pakistan from any quarter and declare that any aggression against Pakistan will evoke an appropriate Chinese response;

affirm that CPEC's security is the common and joint responsibility of Pakistan and China;

offer Pakistan advanced and appropriate weapons systems to defend and deter aggression from the east or the west.

The forthcoming visit of President Trump to China offers the opportunity for a powerful President Xi Jinping to convey China's opposition to America's India-centric policies and destabilising demands on Pakistan, and to propose a plan for comprehensive Sino-US cooperation to advance security and prosperity across Asia, including South Asia and the developing world.

GEN Joseph Dunford, chairman, US joint chiefs of staff, recently stated at a hearing of the US Senate's armed services committee: 'I think in a globalised world there's many belts and many roads and no one nation should put themselves in a position of dictating 'One Belt One Road'. That said, the one belt one road also goes through disputed territory … that in itself shows the vulnerability of trying to establish that sort of a dictate.'

In a separate hearing before the House of Representatives armed services committee, Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis said that China, through its regional partnerships, is 'focused on limiting our ability to project power' and is 'weakening our position in the Indo-Pacific region'.

These statements, one with reference to Gilgit-Baltistan, the other relating more to US political fears, speak less to any applicable international law than it does to the peculiar notion that the US can must be able to influence ties between other sovereign nations. This runs counter to the principle of sovereign equality in international law; while states can, and do, differ in their relative global influence, the underlying legal principle is that all states are equal under international law.

Mattis's reference to 'disputed territory' ignores the principles enshrined in the UN Charter. Article 55(b) obliges the UN to promote 'solutions of international economic, social, health and related problems; and international cultural and educational cooperation', and via Article 56 'all members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in cooperation with the organisation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55'. The entire corpus of international law is predicated upon the notion that states should engage with one another in peaceful, mutually beneficial relationships. The fact that such ties adversely affect one state's ability to project power over others does not render such relationships defunct.

Mattis is tone-deaf to regional realities.

Also, Mattis's use of the term 'disputed territory', while technically correct, still speaks of a failure to understand the geopolitical, historical and legal context of the Kashmir issue. Firstly, the term 'disputed territory' is one which Pakistan maintains; India is content to identify the region as falling within its own sovereign territories. The 'Kashmir issue' is also a political one relating to the legitimate rights of self-determination and political sovereignty of the Kashmiri people.

That Kashmir's status is 'disputed', and to this day eludes resolution, has been recognised consistently by Pakistan. In fact, this recognition, that the region's political status is still unresolved, is why certain political rights, eg the right to vote, have not been extended to its residents. This understanding, that the political status of the region was still undetermined, was reflected in the 1963 Sino-Pakistan Agreement, which established the border between China and Pakistan. The boundaries were, as per Article 6 of the treaty, themselves subject to 'the settlement of the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India', with the parties agreeing that once the Kashmir issue was settled they would renegotiate the agreement to reflect changed geopolitical realities and 'sign a formal boundary treaty to replace the present agreement'.

Mattis also appears tone-deaf to regional historical realities. The CPEC initiative is not the first time China has invested heavily in the region; in 2008, Beijing entered into an agreement with the Earthquake Re­­construction and Rehabilitation Authority to engage in infrastructure development in Kashmir following 2005's devastating quake. Rehabilitation works in Bagh, Muzaffarabad and Rawalakot were assigned to the China Interna­tional Water and Electricity Cor­po­ration and the China Xinjiang Beixin Group both state-owned contracting firms.

Similarly, the Neelum-Jhelum hydroelectric project was also a joint Pakistan-China programme initiated in 2008. The Karakoram Highway, the land route connecting Pakistan and China via Kashmir, was a product of bilateral collaboration dating back to 1959. The KKH was upgraded following a devastating landslide in 2010 again with Chinese assistance.

Such development work in the 'disputed territory' is not unique to China-Pakistan ventures, however; India has also committed to many infrastructure projects in the region's Indian-held portions and the US has never considered such projects in Kashmir a problem in the past.

Fixating merely on the nomenclature of One Belt, One Road obfuscates the real reasons behind US unease with the initiative. Mattis's statements speak to an ahistorical, idealised notion of 'full-spectrum dominance' in which the US sees fit to 'project power' across the world. The 'disputed' nature of Kashmir is not novel, nor is the Kashmiri peoples' right to self-determination under international law. What is novel is America's growing chagrin at possibly being rendered strategically irrelevant in South Asia.


 
 

Change of govt in Islamabad won't affect CPEC:  China

China said on Thursday development work on 19 of 50 projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was already under way.

'It will not be affected by a change in government in Islamabad,' a senior official of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told a group of visiting Pakistani journalists at the foreign office.

'It makes no difference (to China) who comes in (government) and who goes out as both countries have brotherly relations. What matters more is the timely completion of these projects, which we are closely watching. Since the CPEC is a flagship programme of the One Belt One Road (OBOR) project, it is very much important for us and we are keen on its timely completion. We also want Pakistan to seize this opportunity. It must not lose it,' he said.

Says it is not concerned about foreign, local criticism of the multi-billion-dollar project

Asian Affairs Department's Deputy Division Director Liu Pengfei said China wants to complete the CPEC at the earliest because the initiative is important for the people of both countries.

'At the moment, we are satisfied with the pace of CPEC projects. But they will pick up further speed once the infrastructure situation improves in Pakistan,' he said, adding that Punjab will get more benefit along with other provinces from this project.

As for criticism of the CPEC by foreign and local parties, Mr Liu said, 'We are not concerned about voices foreign or local against the CPEC. This project will benefit the people of both countries. We have to ensure its timely completion come what may. We want to let everyone know that China is a brother of Pakistan and stands by it.'

The United States alleged last month that the CPEC worth $56 billion passed through disputed territory. Its allegation was in reference to Pakistan's northern areas, which India claims are part of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir territory. 'The OBOR also goes through the disputed territory, and I think that in itself shows the vulnerability of trying to establish that sort of a dictate,' US Secretary of Defence James Mattis had alleged.

Mr Liu said, 'The CPEC is not passing through any disputed territory in Pakistan.' He said Pakistan and India should resolve the Kashmir issue through peaceful dialogue.


 
 

Russian envoy assuages Indian feelings on Pakistan ties

Russia's envoy to India has sought to assuage Indian worries on Pakistan, saying Moscow's ties with New Delhi were second to none but also underscoring the importance of growing military exercises with Islamabad, the Economic Times said on Thursday.

The paper quoted Russian Ambassador Nikolay Kudashev as saying that strengthening his country's military ties, including conducting military exercises, with Pakistan were focussed on antiterrorism cooperation.

Russia's ties with Pakistan and India could not be 'equalised' and its strategic relations with India were second to those of no other nation.

In response to a possible quadrilateral dialogue between Japan, India, the US and Australia and growing ties between the first three, aimed at counterbalancing China's maritime pursuits, the envoy said the concept in the Indo-Pacific rather should be of an 'open regional architecture where there is space for everyone'.

On the sidelines of a press briefing on the recently concluded first Indo-Russia tri-services exercise, Indra2017, Mr Kudashev covered India's emerging defence partnership with Japan, the Malabar naval exercise and Russia's views on it.

'I would say we welcome a larger bloc with an open regional architecture, where there would be space for all and space for trust and confidence. Naturally, India, Russia and Japan included.'

When asked if Russia would be interested in joining the recently proposed quadrilateral dialogue, he said that different 'combinations' were possible and in Asia there was need for international cooperation and space for everyone.

Such a concept of cooperation will be raised at the East Asia Summit, a forum for strategic dialogue and cooperation between countries of the Asia-Pacific region to be held in the Philippines in November. India, China, Russia, Japan, Australia and the US are members of the summit.

The Economic Times said that last month Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono in a media interview had said that Japan would propose a top-level dialogue with the US, India and Australia.

It would be for promoting free trade and defence cooperation from the South China Sea, across the Indian Ocean and up to Africa. It was aimed at counteracting China's growing assertiveness under its 'Belt and Road initiative', the paper said.

India responded by saying that it 'is open to working with like-minded countries on issues that advance its interests'.

Meanwhile, in response to a question on Russia's military exercise with Pakistan, the paper quoted Mr Kudashev as saying: 'I don't see an opportunity to equalise relations between Russia and Pakistan and Russia and India. Our partnership with India is second to no one. We have normal interstate relations with Pakistan.

'The purpose of the drills is counterterrorism in nature and supports elements in Pakistan and to counter the menace. We should look at a common denominator which is fighting terror.'

In September last year, Russia and Pakistan held their first joint exercise called 'Druzhba 2016' (Friendship 2016). This year again, the paper noted, the special forces of Russia and Pakistan conducted a joint counterterrorism exercise in the Mineralnye Vody region in Russia.

Russia's ties with Pakistan have become stronger since the two signed a military cooperation agreement in 2014. In 2015, the two sides finalised a deal for four Mi35 attack helicopters for Pakistan.

According to the Economic Times, the Russian ambassador also said that the Indra exercise between Russian and Indian armed forces could involve more advanced weaponry in future. More than 900 Indian defence services personnel participated in the exercise with the Russian defence forces from October 19 to 29.

Speakers at a conference on Friday called for creating awareness among the people of Gilgit-Baltistan about the opportunities promised by the multibillion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project for them.

They, however, expressed fear that smoke from traffic of CPEC passing through GB would destroy the natural environment of the region, and demanded redressal of the environmental degradation issues before operationalisation of the project.

The conference titled 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor - Prospects and Opportunities for Gilgit-Baltistan, was held at the Karakoram International University's (KIU) main campus in Gilgit.

It was organised by the Centre for Research on CPEC at the KIU, the Centre of Excellence on CPEC Islamabad, Pakistan Customs and Higher Education Commission.

Speaking on the occasion, Hasan Dawood, Project Director CPEC Cell, said nine economic zones were being established under CPEC in the country, adding Maqpoondas had been identified for establishing a CPEC economic zone in GB.

'At Maqpoondas fruit processing, minerals cutting and polishing centres, iron and steel industries would be established, he said.

Mr Dawood said KKH expansion, building of Gilgit-Chitral road, establishment of Phandar hydropower project in Ghizer, KIU hydropower project in Gilgit, Diamer-Bhasha Dam and China-Pakistan optical fiber project were being executed under the CPEC.

Executive Director CPEC Dr Shahid Rasheed said the purpose of the conference was to create awareness about the project among the participants and discuss the prospects, opportunities and way forward for GB.

He said the One Belt One Road project had been divided into six corridors and the CPEC was one of the pilot corridors.

GB minister for education Ibrahim Sanai said CPEC also connected civilisations and created harmony in the world. He said India was hatching conspiracies to foil the project.

Sadia Niazi, an expert, said CPEC constructions posed threat for ecological degradation in the region, and called for steps to avoid the phenomenon.

GB customs collector Ali Raza said time limit for clearing containers at Sust dry port should be decreased. He also demanded to keep the Khunjerab border open throughout the year.

Rani Atiqa Ghazanfar, member of Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly, said confusion and ambiguity prevailed among GB people, based on a narrative created by pessimists who were unable to see direct and indirect benefits of CPEC.

'We hope GB people would get fair share in the mega project,' she said, adding she believed tourism industry alone had the potential to revive the local economy.

Ms Ghazanfar said in the prevailing situation they were expecting influx of foreign tourists, including the Chinese in the years to come due to the CPEC and asked the locals to brace for the challenge.

THIS is apropos the article 'One Belt One Road' by law experts Sikander Ahmed Shah and Abid Rizvi (Oct 29). While criticising the controversial statement of US Defence Secretary Mattis on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the two law experts opined in their article that the 'KKH is a land route connecting Pakistan and China via Kashmir'.

To corroborate their ideas, they tried to compare the CPEC to the Rehabilitation Works carried out by China in the post-2005 earthquake period. These contradictory comments of these two law experts in response to a contradictory statement of the US Defence Secretary made the CPEC a truly controversial subject.

It seems to me that Gilgit-Baltistan is an unknown place to our own scholars as the American secretary was absolutely right in saying that the CPEC had to cross through Gilgit-Baltistan rather than Kashmir. Our educational elite is unaware of the fact that the freedom of GB was won by our own ancestors from the Dogra Raj on Nov 1, 1947, who ruled it as an autonomous region till Nov 16, 1947, with Shah Rais Khan as its first local president.

It must be noted that Kashmir was under the rule of Ghulab Singh those days. So, it is direly needed that our mainstream historians and scholars should dwell deep into our history regardless of any prejudice. This will not only increase our knowledge, but will also surely shut up those who raise questions about the sovereignty of Pakistan. Also, for the smooth progress of the CPEC, the constitutional mainstreaming of GB is a must.

Bank of China (BoC) formally began its operations in Pakistan on Tuesday, with the official launch performed by President Mamnoon Hussain at Aiwan-e-Sadr.

Addressing the launch ceremony, President Hussain said the bank would play an important role in providing the required resources for promoting commercial activities and developing infrastructure.

He said this development would lead to further improvement in national growth rate, and people particularly the business community would be able to effectively assist in making business environment more conducive.

The opening of BoC indicates the benefits of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project which transformed from a dream into reality in the last few years would soon start reaching the masses and give impetus to active political and economic relations between the two countries, the president said.

China has emerged as a major investor and partner for Pakistan which is a positive development and will lead to materialising the possibilities of development in both the countries, he said.

With the initiation of the CPEC project, infrastructure sector in Pakistan has witnessing splendid growth. Due to sound economic policies of the government, the investment climate in the country had become favourable, he added.

The bank's entry is expected to speed up trade and economic cooperation under CPEC

The president was confident that the evergreen Pak-China friendship will further grow with the start of BoC's operations which would speed up trade and economic cooperation between Pakistan and China.

Speaking on the occasion, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Tariq Bajwa said the BoC, being a key partner in China's 'One Belt One Road' initiative, would be effectively able to cater to the financing needs of CPEC projects by leveraging its specialised services and expertise.

He was confident that the emergence of BoC on the financial horizon of Pakistan will be beneficial for the country's banking industry. Growing linkages between Pakistan and China would create a better future for all of us, he observed.

He said the presence of BoC in Pakistan is also expected to benefit the banking sector through technology transfers and associated innovation in products and processes, human capital development and improved competition and efficiency in the financial services.

Earlier, acting ambassador of China in Pakistan, Mr Zhao Lijian described the start of operation in Pakistan by the BoC as a milestone. The bank has returned to this part of the world since 1942 when BoC had opened a branch in Karachi, he added.

The said branch along with the Chittagong branch was later transferred to the National Bank of Pakistan in 1971 after the bank closed its operations in the region.

Mr Lijian hoped that the Chinese financial institutions would also enter into the Pakistani market in the near future. BoC would continue to expand its business coverage in the country and play an important role in building Pak-China friendship, he said.

Chairman BoC Chen Siqing said the bank considered Pakistan as a strategic location for its operation. The bank would play its role in the economy of Pakistan and help the country achieve economic gains, he said.

'A large part of the community is suffering from mutual hatred, ethnocentric mindset, intolerance, extremism and terrorism. Creating and promoting diversity is a noble cause under such circumstances,' said Dr Hasan Askari Rizvi, professor emeritus, Punjab University, in his keynote address at the inauguration of an international conference titled 'Diversity and peace: challenges to social discourse' organised by the faculty of social sciences, University of Karachi, on Tuesday.

'The need of the hour is to promote political accommodation of diversity and a culture of tolerance and harmony through a dialogue across all kinds of divides that we encounter today. We need to build bridges of cooperation, positive interaction, dialogue and mutual sharing rather than barriers and walls that divide us and cause mutual distrust and conflict,' he said.

'Religious and cultural extremism and terrorism dating back to the 1980s involved domestic and global factors and adversely affected Pakistani society and Pakistan lost the societal feature of cultural and religious tolerance and political accommodation. Academicians and intellectuals have a leading role in encouraging dialogue among different sections of society. Dialogue among people of different lands and their governments is essential to accommodate diversity and emphasise pluralism,' he added.

'Currently, there is a realisation of what has gone wrong with Pakistan, the efforts of the state and society to counter violent and terrorist activities in the country and also intolerance. The state is also making serious efforts for the promotion of dialogue and accommodation, which is indeed commendable,' said Dr Askari.

Earlier, KU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Mohammad Ajmal Khan welcomed all the scholars, including visiting scholars from abroad. He said social sciences was no longer an isolated field. Rather it had gained significant importance in the backdrop of the political, social and economic events taking place in the world. 'These changes are no longer limited by political, physical and natural boundaries; the need for the intellectual community to conduct critical debate on theories and practices of conflict resolution, inter-cultural harmony, peace and development has increased manifold,' he said.

'This conference will not only strengthen the ideology of Pakistan but also unleash the process of meaningful academic discourse which can positively transform the mindset of our people and bring a qualitative change in our society through meaningful research in the field of social sciences,' said Dr Ajmal Khan.

Dr Ghulam Raza Bhatti, member (operations and planning), HEC, said that man was a scavenger, who ate everything he saw Dean of the faculty of social sciences Prof Dr Mohammad Ahmed Qadri said Pakistan is a land of peace which respected all cultures and ideologies.

While presenting his paper Prof Dr Qadri with Dr Xiaoqing Xie from the China University of Geosciences said that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and One Belt One Road projects were closely linked.

Dr Olena Bordilovska of Kyiv Taras Shevchenko National University, Ukraine, while presenting her research paper said that Ukraine, as one of the so-called New Independent States, was a bright example of both peace proclamations and security challenges.

Paulina Fecht from the University of Heidelberg, Germany, while presenting her research paper said the post-Second World War era was a revolution in itself due to the emerging trend of reconciliation among the European states, which was unprecedented in the past due to power politics.

Dr Yahya Yesilyurt from Kastamonu University, Turkey, said that due to Turkey's geographical position, it would have the role of a coordinator, which would provide power to the region, and it would also be able to generate promising policies on a global scale. For this reason, the developing countries such as Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Indonesia had a share in the regional developments and contribution to world peace.

Scholars from China, Turkey and Ukraine called for signing memorandums of understanding with the University of Karachi on behalf of their national universities for a student/faculty exchange programme.


 
 

 China -US: shaping the future

THIS century's future will be largely defined by the relationship between a rising China and a resentful America.

China has so far risen peacefully. Over 40 years, the US and China have developed an interdependent economic and a largely cooperative political relationship. The positive tone of the two Xi-Trump summits generates hope that China and America may yet avoid the Thucydides Trap (which postulates the inevitability of a clash between an established and rising power).

At the recent 19th CPC Congress, President Xi Jinping outlined China's rather modest objectives: to become 'a moderately prosperous country' and a 'fully modern' economy and society by 2035 and 'a global leader of composite national strength and international influence' by 2050.

The rivalry between China and the US will depend on the vibrancy of their governance systems.

On the other hand, Trump's 'America First' slogan is a signal of a determination to win back the economic, political and strategic pre-eminence which the US enjoyed over the last 70 years. Trump's 'ideologue', Steve Bannon, (out of office but still influential), sees China as 'the greatest -term threat to the US'. He said: 'We have to reassert ourselves as the real Asian power....'

Fortunately, Trump has so far stepped back from his campaign denunciations of China and erosion of the 'One China' policy and focused instead on securing Chinese cooperation to confront the North Korean nuclear threat and to redress the Sino-US trade 'imbalance'. However, Trump may be disappointed if these aims are not achieved in the near term. This could lead to a more confrontational course, especially since even his 'grown-up' advisers, like Defence Secretary Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, see China more as a rival than a partner and have outlined policies to contain, and if needed, to confront it.

In the economic sphere, the US enjoys several advantages: the US dollar is the world's main reserve currency; the US heavily influences, if not controls, global financial markets and institutions; it sits at the top of several 'supply chain' networks, and maintains a (narrowing) lead in innovation and new technologies. But 'demand' in the US economy is low since people's 'basic needs' have been met and population growth is slow. Manufacturing jobs have been lost offshore due to high wages and aging equipment. They are unlikely to return. Despite massive financial injections, the US growth is not more than two to three per cent.

China's growth has been driven to a considerable extent by exports and investment. It is now vulnerable on the external front given rising Chinese wages and Western trade protectionism. However, trade dependency is a two-way street. And, the Chinese economy will continue to grow due to rising demand from: the 300 million Chinese who are even now emerging from poverty, the rapidly expanding consumerism of China's growing 'middle class' and the trillion dollars to be invested in projects under the historic Belt and Road Initiative. Meanwhile, China is creating an alternative financial structure that could eventually challenge the US-dominated financial system and it is investing heavily, at all levels, in advanced technology.

The US retains a significant military edge over China. Its $600 billion military budget is more than four times larger than China's. The US possesses and is developing cutting-edge weapons systems and war-fighting techniques. It has established formal and informal military alliances with a number of militarily significant states, including three of Asia's largest powers: Japan, India and Australia. The US will continue attempts to exploit China's maritime disputes in the South China Sea and to build a string of alliances around China's periphery to mobilise resistance to China's influence in the region.

However, China is rapidly developing the capacity to confront or neutralise America's military advantage. First, although China's defence budget is smaller ($150bn), it can deliver a 'bigger bang for the buck' (due to the huge cost differentials between China and the US). Second, under President Xi Jinping's guidance, the PLA is being comprehensively reformed to become a 'technologically sophisticated army'. China is spending heavily on military R and D. Some of the weapons systems it has recently unveiled have surprised Western military observers.

Of course, America's Asian military alliances are formidable. China's only strategic and military 'partner' now is Pakistan. But to a considerable extent, China will be able to circumvent the US and 'allied' naval dominance across the Indo-Pacific through the Belt and Road connection across Eurasia. Notably, CPEC will transform China from a one-ocean to a two-ocean power.

Second, China is building strong economic and military links with a resurgent Russia which will amply balance America's Asian alliances. Finally, India, if not Japan and Australia, may turn out to be a 'fake friend'. China is its largest trading partner; while India will welcome America's economic, military and technological largesse, it is unlikely to confront China militarily, especially not to advance US interests.

While America's historical alliances no doubt enhance its global power and influence, it is also severely constrained, politically and militarily, by 'legacy issues', such as the unconditional commitment to Israel; the 'war on terror'; the intervention in Iraq; the confrontation with Iran; the Afghan quagmire; and the 'new Cold War' with Russia.

Most importantly, the outcome of the strategic rivalry between China and America will depend on the vibrancy and credibility of their respective systems of governance. China's 'socialist democracy' is now seen as a most effective form of government. In contrast, the US political system seems to be broken, divided and corrupt.

In an incisive article last month, entitled: 'When China Leads', Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister of Australia, writes: 'The West, by and large, has no idea what awaits it as China continues its rise. The United States ... has become a global laughingstock.... Europe ... remains a rolling seminar on itself...'. He adds: 'It would be reckless to assume, as many still do in the US, Europe, and elsewhere, that China's transition to global pre-eminence will somehow simply implode....'

In such circumstances, Washington would be wise to consider seriously Xi Jinping's proposal to create 'a community of a shared future for mankind'.


 
 

Transit trade

IT'S home to almost a quarter of the world's population and has been one of the fastest-growing regions on earth. A young, enterprising population living here is eager to find its place in the world and could deliver a historic demographic dividend. Yet for all its potential, South Asia continues to be one of the least integrated places.

Inter-regional trade, says the World Bank, accounts for barely five per cent of South Asia's total trade. Compare this to Asean, where inter-regional trade accounts for over a quarter of total trade. This isn't surprising: South Asia is plagued by geopolitical tensions and a history of distrust and disputes, particularly between India and Pakistan, that stymie any progress towards greater economic integration.

The myopia of this region's policymakers is showcased in the impasse between Afghanistan and Pakistan on providing the former greater access to the Indian market through a land route. While Pakistan allows Afghanistan land access to India for its exports, it does not allow Indian goods to make their way to Afghanistan via the same route Indian exports to Afghanistan must be routed via Pakistan's seaports.

This policy has skewed Afghanistan's trade ties with India and has become a major sticking point of late. According to data made public by Kabul, Afghanistan's exports to India have increased by 227pc, from $70 million in 2011 to $230m in 2016. However, its imports from India in this same period have grown by only 47pc, from $103m in 2011 to $152m in 2016. During the same period Afghanistan's exports to Pakistan increased by 57pc, from $180m in 2011 to $283m in 2016, while imports from Pakistan have increased by 37pc, from $877m in 2011 to $1.2 billion in 2016.

Politics should not obstruct regional trade.

The curbs on Afghanistan's imports from India mean that trucks crossing Wagah with Afghan exports to India must return empty, thereby increasing transportation costs for the country's exporters. Secondly, the restrictions make it more expensive for Afghanistan to purchase Indian goods. Finally, these limitations bolster anti-Pakistan sentiment in Afghanistan. Last month, the Afghan government banned Pakistani trucks from entering Afghanistan, after claiming that Pakistan had stopped allowing Afghan trucks from crossing the Durand Line.

To circumvent these barriers, India and Afghanistan announced an air corridor, which was followed by the first shipment of Indian wheat to Afghanistan via the strategic Chabahar Port in Iran. These alternative routes will increasingly play a major role in bolstering Afghanistan-Iran-India trade ties, while isolating Pakistan from lucrative trade networks. It is worth mentioning that Iranian exports to Afghanistan have increased by 118pc, going from $581m to $1.3bn in 2016.

By not giving India access to the land route via Wagah, Pakistan also risks its plans to use CPEC as a gateway to Central Asia. That route must go through Afghanistan. President Ashraf Ghani recently said his country won't be a part of CPEC unless it is given access to India via a land crossing. Unless a deal is reached, the billions of dollars of transit fees, essential for meeting CPEC repayment obligations, will be at risk.

While elites in Pakistan view Chabahar as a competitor to Gwadar, the Chinese are less keen to view this as a zero-sum game. In fact, Chinese officials are on the record as saying that they see Iran as a key plank in the One Belt, One Road (Obor) initiative. With Pakistani policymakers unable to generate sufficient momentum to meet Kabul's demands on the land route, one can expect the Chinese to hedge their bets, especially if billions of dollars of goods begin to go through Chabahar and into Afghanistan and Central Asia.

Sceptics will argue that China is an all-weather friend and would not undercut Pakistan, that Chabahar is India's pet project and that India has been vehemently opposing Obor. While that may be true, it would be prudent to look at the fact that China is India's largest trading partner, with annual bilateral trade amounting to more than $70bn. This summer, Indian and Chinese forces came face to face in Doklam, but trade continued to grow at the height of the crisis. Further, India is a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

China's goal is to foster greater regional trade and cooperation by developing essential infrastructure that facilitates this trade. India is one of the largest economies in the region and the Chinese recognise that it has a role to play in promoting greater regional trade. These trade routes can run through Pakistan, allowing it to earn revenue through the transit trade, or through alternative routes via Iran. To become a conduit for goods flowing to Central Asia, Islamabad must provide full access to India's markets via a land route.


 
 

Fixing Afghanistan

ATTEMPTS to fix Afghanistan have accelerated after the Trump-led US administration announced its South Asia policy in August. Regional actors are realigning their positions to respond to the new US policy as well as to other emerging geopolitical and geo-economic dynamics in the region, which will certainly take time. Pakistan remains at the heart of the new US policy on Afghanistan, although for reasons which Islamabad does not approve of.

The Trump-led US administration seems to have chalked out a long-term strategy keeping in view that defeating the Afghan Taliban militarily is not possible. Apparently, the US objective is to not allow the Taliban to win or to protract the conflict. Washington will try to achieve its goal with minimum increase in troops on the ground.

The Quadrilateral Coordination Group set up in 2015 for talks with the Afghan Taliban and consisting of the US, China, Afghanistan and Pakistan would be one component of America's political strategy. Backchannel efforts to engage Afghan Taliban commanders and to encourage them to join the government are also seen as an integral part of this strategy. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently hinted at the inclusion of 'moderate' Taliban in the Afghan government, although he did not elaborate who these moderate elements would be; nor is it clear if the Taliban themselves would accept the US definition.

The US knows the sensitivities involved and will continue exploiting these to get Pakistan to cooperate.

Washington wants certain roles for regional actors and appears to have divided the latter into two clusters immediate neighbours and stakeholders. In the short to medium term, the US wants Pakistan to take action against the Haqqanis and force the Afghan Taliban to participate in the process of political reconciliation. The removal of the Lashkar-e-Taiba from the US National Defence Authorisation Act provision would have required the US defence secretary to certify that Pakistan has taken steps to 'significantly disrupt' the activities of both the LeT and the Haqqani network. That is a significant indication of a palpably changing scenario.

However, it can be interpreted both ways that the US will increase pressure on Pakistan to deliver more on the Afghanistan front or that Pakistan has convinced the Trump administration it will handle the local groups alone through coercive ways or reintegration. The removal of the LeT's name indicates that the Milli Muslim League project has been successful in easing some of the pressure on Islamabad, which does not want to see its Indian-centric strategic priorities confused with US regional politics or its own security calculus.

The US knows the sensitivities and will continue exploiting these to get Pakistan to cooperate. Though the message is clear about what the US expects in return, would it be possible for Pakistan to deliver on the Haqqani front, especially when it is clear that Washington wants the Haqqanis at the table or to confront them on the battlefield in Afghanistan?

President Trump in his policy review speech had announced America would quit the nation-building project in Afghanistan, but how would he then achieve stability in the latter country? Apparently, Washington wants to outsource the 'nation-building' project to India and wants it to play a greater role in economic affairs and institutional building in Afghanistan.

Policymakers in Washington know that New Delhi would not put its troops on the ground in Afghanistan. However, the Indian preference would be to play a calculated political, strategic and economic role in Afghanistan without exceeding the strategic and financial costs too much. India is one of the major beneficiaries of the crisis in Afghanistan, and has been trying to replace Pakistan on the strategic and trade fronts in Afghanistan. The US will continue to pursue India for playing a greater role in building infrastructure and institutions in Afghanistan.

Architects of the US policy see a special role for China in Afghanistan as being directly involved in the peace-building process. Regional peace and stability are crucial for the One Belt, One Road initiative but Beijing will not take any lead role in resolving regional disputes, preferring to work in partnership with the US, Russia, Pakistan and Iran.

US Defence Secretary James Mattis criticised Russia and Iran for providing military and financial support to Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. The US may not have major concerns about Russia's part in any resolution of the Afghan crisis, but would not like an active role for Iran. It will prefer to give this role to Central Asian neighbours both in political-economic and strategic terms.

America's Afghan policy appears aggressive and is apparently based on the assumption of semi or unconditional support from regional actors. But it has not considered the interests of other actors. At the same time, it is based on a perception that the Taliban are a divided camp. On the other hand, Kabul presumes the militant Islamic State group to be a lesser threat despite its increasing influence and attacks in Afghanistan. Russia and China are more concerned about the IS but Washington deems fixing the Afghan Taliban will reduce the space for IS though it has killed more US troops than the Taliban. On the other hand, despite reports of possible collaboration between the Taliban and the IS, the potential of the threat has not been assessed as yet.

The US is, nevertheless, not anticipating a complete victory in Afghanistan and is ready to capitalise on partial successes on the military, political and diplomatic fronts. This approach creates doubts about America's real intentions towards its partners and stakeholders. Recently, the Pakistani prime minister's adviser on national security, retired Gen Nasser Janjua, talked of the closure of the Afghan war theatre at a ministerial-level gathering in Samarkand. He demanded an honest review of America's previous approaches as well. It is not clear whether these were his personal views or if the establishment also supports this idea. Nor is it clear what would be the modalities of shutting down the war theatre in Afghanistan. But it is an idea worthy of consideration.


 
 

Asia-Pacific a global destination for investment: UN

With a combined GDP of 27.25 trillion that is growing rapidly, Asia-Pacific is on its way to becoming the most important market in the world, opening possibilities for further expansion of trade and investment within the region, a new report of the United Nations says.

This could contribute to job creation, poverty reduction and the boosting of economic growth throughout the region, according to the report, 'Enhancing Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration in Asia and the Pacific' released by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

The report was released during the second ministerial conference on Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration (RECI) in Asia and the Pacific, co-hosted by ESCAP and Asian Development Bank which opened in Bangkok on Tuesday.

A particularly important initiative that could support further moves towards enhanced RECI in the Asia-Pacific region is China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The initiative aims at enhancing seamless connectivity through a multi-modal network that connects road and rail routes with seaports, expands energy networks through oil and gas pipelines and regional power grids, and extends ICT fibre optic links from China to Europe through Central Asia.

Building this infrastructure and establishing economic corridors is essential for the region to make significant progress in other components of RECI, such as promoting trade and investment flows.

The region is a major global destination for investment, which is reflected by the inflows into the region and between countries within the region. More recently, Asia-Pacific countries have quickly gained global prominence as major outward investors as well.

In 2015, investment outflows from developing Asian economies reached $323 billion, representing 30 per cent of global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows.

However, the noodle bowl of multiple investment agreements, which are not always aligned with sustainable development principles, are adversely affecting further increases in FDI flows.

Countries need to promote regional investment regimes in a manner that better balances investors' rights with the host country's development needs.

This would enable countries to not only attract more FDI to contribute to sustainable development, but also to achieve better market integration.

The report says that strong regional political will and agreed regional visions among countries are critical for establishing effective, region-wide planning and coordination mechanisms for regional connectivity.

Pakistan is going to demand a larger representation in the next South Asia Business Forum (SABF) conference, which is organised by the China Council for Promotion of International Trade every year in Kunming.

Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Vice Presi­dent Saqib Fayyaz Magoon is expected to take up the matter during the 13th preparatory meeting, which will be held on Thursday in Maldives.

Talking to Dawn on Tuesday, Mr Magoon said that being a major link under China's One Belt, One Road initiative, Pakistan should have proper representation at the forum, which aims to promote regional trade.

He expressed hope that China would support Pakistan's demand for a larger representation at the three-day conference.

Mr Mangoo said that despite being a host to the 12th SABF conference early this year, only one representative from the FPCCI participated in the event. Contrary to this, other regional players had larger participation with their representatives introducing and highlighting trade opportunities that their respective countries offered.

The SABF provides countries with an opportunity to promote trade and seek investment. A trade fair is also held in which participating countries display their produce.

Continuous engagement between Afghanistan and Pakistan is needed amid constantly evolving regional dynamics, particularly in the context of Afghanistan, speakers at a seminar on Afghanistan-Pakistan relations said on Wednesday.

Both countries should also invest in structuring people-to-people relations, which would help strengthen ties between the countries, speakers said.

The seminar focused on the changing dynamics and future of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations, and consisted of discussions regarding the United States' Afghanistan strategy, transit trade through Pakistan and people-to-people contact. It was hosted by the Pak Institute of Peace Studies (Pips), and organised with the support of Frederick Ebert Stiftung.

The seminar consisted of two sessions: one on 'Geopolitics and geo-economics of Pakistan-Afghanistan relations', and another on 'People to people relations'.

The participants included Afghan Ambassador Omar Zakhilwal, who said that the relations between both countries were gradually improving, noting that progress was made after a visit Pakistan's chief of army staff made to Afghanistan two months ago.

Mr Zakhilwal said Afghan President Ashraf Ghani may soon visit Pakistan. He also called for expediting the trust-building process, and said there were many commonalities between both countries but interference by the state in every sector had had an adverse effect on people-to-people relations.

Speakers also discussed the impact of the new American strategy for Afghanistan on Pakistan, particularly in the context of inviting India to play a role in Afghanistan.

Dr Ishtiaq Ahmed, vice chancellor of the University of Sargodha, said he hoped that the Indo-Pak rivalry would not dent the reconciliation process in Afghanistan.

Rolf Paasch from Friedrich Ebert Stiftung also spoke about Russia and China's roles in the region, saying that Russian-American and China-US relations also had consequences for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Former ambassador Aziz Ahmed Khan, however, noted that China has remained neutral on the issue.

Pips Director Mohammad Amir Rana discussed the future of Pak-Afghan relations in the context of the One Belt One Road initiative, hoping that it would trigger new transformation in the region, thereby rebuilding them.

Mr Khan said that whatever the Trump administration's new policy for Afghanistan was, there was a need to reduce the trust deficit between the two countries, which would only be possible with the resumption of the negotiation process. He added that other regional countries should play their role for facilitation.

'We need to engage with each other at the parliamentarian, civil society, economic and security levels and transit trade issues also need to be sorted out. More focus should be on geo-economic dynamics rather than security,' he said.

Former senator Afrasiab Khattak warned of becoming entangled in regional polarisation, saying people-to-people relations between neighbouring countries were encouraging. 'We have stronger people-to-people relations with India and the US but not with Afghanistan. More programmes in different sectors could play an important role in this regard.'

On people-to-people relations, former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief secretary Khalid Aziz said people-to-people relations are unstructured, despite a lot of potential, and regretted that the matter of repatriation of Afghan refugees was not taken into consideration. The entire issue, he said, was being dehumanised.

Television anchor Saleem Safi, meanwhile, called upon the media in both countries to portray each other positively, which columnist Marvi Sirmed agreed with. Ms Sirmed said Pakistan should allow Afghan television channels to air in Pakistan, and called for the engagement of the media and civil society in track II diplomacy and for the visa regime to be made flexible.

PRESIDENT Mamnoon Hussain, while addressing the eighth convocation of the Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS) in Islamabad on Nov 29, highlighted some deplorable conditions Pakistan is facing today. The first and foremost is foreign debts. The debts swelled from Rs7.000bn in 2008 to Rs14,800bn in 2013. However, no visible development in the power sector was made during this period. Unfortunately, the Kalabagh dam issue has been politicised and a large water reservoir has been denied to Pakistan through intrigues.

If we want the One-Belt-One-Road (OBOR) and the China-Pakistan Economic Cooperation(CPEC) projects to succeed, we have to be well prepared and well-equipped for changes to come.

The president should advise our government to curtail its expenses as it puts a heavy burden on the national kitty. He is qualifued enough,was once president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and knows the value of money.

A Lanka-Sino joint venture is set to run the China-funded $1.4 billion Hambantota Port.

The joint venture was officially lau­nched here on Saturday by Prime Minister Ranil Wic­kremesinghe.

Mr Wickremesinghe described the occasion as 'historic', as it will help make the Hambantota Port part of Sri Lanka's grand scheme to make the island nation the maritime hub of the Indian Ocean.

As a result of the joint venture, the Hambantota Port will be the largest multi-purpose port in Sri Lanka while also being the island's single largest private investment.

The joint venture is between the public sector, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) of the Government of Sri Lanka and the China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPH). It envisages making Hambantota Port part of China's One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative.

The aim is to make the Hambantota Port a 'total logistics solution provider,' the CMPH said in a statement.

As result of the Concessional Agreement dated July 29, 2017, two companies have been formed to run the Hambantota Port the Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) and the Hambantota International Port Services Co Pvt Ltd.

With $294 million handed in, the CMPH has given, as down payment, 40 per cent of the total of $1.2 billion pledged to the port as per the Concession Agreement.

Sri Lanka will have three ports one in the West (Colombo), one in the South (Hambantota), and one in the East (Trincomalee) to make it an ideal maritime hub of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), Sri Lanka's Prime Minister said.

Through OBOR, Sri Lanka will become a maritime hub as it was in pre-colonial times when the Chinese had a maritime silk route girdling the globe, the Lankan prime minister said.

Sri Lanka lost its place in the maritime route because of the disruption of the system by the colonial powers, he explained.

Mr Wickremsinghe said that the Hambantota Port will be part of a larger scheme to make the area around it a hub of industrial activity with a cement plant and an oil refinery coming up in the proposed Economic Zone.

In a document released on the occasion of the inauguration it was stated the aim of the government of Sri Lanka and CMPH is to transform Hambantota Port from a 'transshipment hub' to a 'total logistics hub' of the Indian Ocean region.

For the CMPH, Hambantota is the second investment in Sri Lanka, the first being the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT). The CICT, which is the first phase of the Colombo South Harbor project, has been in existence for the past five years.

Executive Vice Chairman of CMPH, Dr Hu Jianhua said the joint venture will provide training and employment to Sri Lankans, especially the people of Hambantota district. Already, many local youth have gone for training in other projects run by the CMPH, he said.

Considering alternative routes

WHEN one talks of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, images of highways, bridges, railway lines, seaports and airports with a massive movement of goods and passengers connected to such a network come to mind. There is a different version of CPEC too, one in which, in addition to a transportation network, there are energy projects and the development of economic zones along this corridor. Despite a major portion of the investment being devoted to energy, the success of the entire project rests on an efficient and viable transportation system to facilitate the export of China's manufactured goods as well as the import of raw materials and gas/oil for the large manufacturing units coming up in western China. The corridor will cut down costs and save shipping costs that are incurred by using an expensive and long-existing option. Thus, enormous savings are projected for China, in addition to being an economic boom for Pakistan, and resulting in accelerated prosperity for Pakistanis.

A glance at Pakistan's map starting from Gwadar to Khunjerab Pass, the entry point into China, shows a massive network of roads that connect to the motorways and highways and finally converge on a single highway that leads to Khunjerab in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB). If one looks at the route starting from the north, one can note a single highway traversing through a difficult terrain, then branching off in all directions within Pakistan and towards the highways that lead to the ports of Gwadar and Karachi. With this map before us, it appears that the entire heavy transportation of goods from the now massively developed industrial area of western China will be confined to a single highway, with almost 800 kilometres winding through one of the world's most difficult mountainous terrains, through this most economical and short route to the seaports. Similarly, heavy transportation convoys will also converge on the same highway to the north to enter China.

With a record investment of over $50 billion by China, this transportation corridor is key to the success of its One Belt, One Road vision. It has unmatched opportunities for Pakistan as well as for China, and the road network will be the primary mode of transportation for the entire project. Surprisingly, the design appears to be based on unsound assumptions, as a single-approach highway entering China cannot sustain smooth flow of the projected heavy traffic that will likely continue to increase. In particular, the portion of road from Khunjerab to Gilgit is so unstable that to keep it open, five tunnels have been constructed to avoid frequent landslides at some unsteady points.

Multiple land connections are key to CPEC's success.

It is incredible that this massive project has been based on a single road situated for much of its length through a very uneven terrain that is prone to landslides. Another incident such as the one that formed Attabad Lake could result in transportation between the two countries being suspended for months, with resulting losses in the shape of time and failure to meet the deadline for delivery of goods. It is time to look at other options of alternate routes and include them for development as part of our CPEC plan. There is an alternate direct route from China through Mustagh Pass that was open till 1905. This was a regular route for the movement of the small-trade caravans, but was closed due to the growth of the glaciers. With modern construction technology, it is now possible to build the road even through the glaciers, with the route passing through Shigar Valley and connecting to Islamabad through Neelum Valley and joining the vast highway and motorway networks towards the seaports. A third route could be built through the Wakhan Corridor in Afghanistan to Chitral, and from there it could join the road network in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

It must be remembered that CPEC is not merely a trade route or an economic development project. It also has tremendous strategic importance that in addition to furnishing extraordinary opportunities of commercial advantage to challenge the international economic giants also extends the outreach of the emerging superpower of China to warm waters. This has naturally attracted attention from countries hostile to Pakistan and apprehensive of Chinese interest in Pakistan. Similarly, facilitating the Chinese is also viewed with fear by the economies competing internationally.

With this kind of adverse environment, it is most important that all possible risks are assessed to keep the wheels of commerce moving through this corridor by providing viable alternatives. Depending on a single entry through a difficult terrain with security threats on some of the disturbed portions of the corridor may not be very prudent. A crowded highway with slow-moving heavy transportation without an alternative route is a natural target for antagonistic elements, whether foreign or local. Any disruption of this frail link of a single road will compromise the viability of the entire project, with devastating repercussions for Pakistan and serious economic consequences for China.

No physical barrier should obstruct an economic corridor that will be a game-changer for billions of people. China has the technology, the resources and the desire to make CPEC a success. This must be put to maximum use to make viable proposed alternate routes so that the success of this project results in cutting costs and saves Chinese cargo ships from passing through crowded sea lanes, mostly through unfriendly stretches of water. For Pakistan, the success of CPEC is essential to its dream of economic development and for China it is a vital link in its OBOR vision. Indubitably, any setback to CPEC will also imperil the success of this vision. Hence, addressing this key issue will guarantee the success of this major undertaking by China.


 
 

New US policy (2)

HETrump administration's first foreign policy announcement as far as Pakistan is concerned is more or less the same as that of his predecessor. Pakistan has once again been made the scapegoat and is expected to sacrifice its national interests for Washington.

President Donald Trump as expected is bent upon ensuring America's hegemony and countering China and Russia. This is more of the same strategy America practised during the cold war. The sole US objective for its presence in Afghanistan for its so-called 'war on terror' is to make trouble for Beijing and Moscow and deny them access to the natural resources in their vicinity.

Pakistan's relations with Washington these days are frosty to put it mildly and likely to become colder owing to what the US expects from friends. It is not possible for Pakistan to implement Washington's 'do more' mantra.

Islamabad will do well to remember that the long-term US plan is to oppose the One Belt One Road initiative, more specifically CPEC. Moreover, Washington's protectionist policies are against the global transformation of trade initiatives taken by Chinese President Xi Jingping.


 
 

US-Israel-India nexus in the making: Rabbani

In a hard-hitting speech at the six-nation Speakers Confe­rence, Senate Chairman Raza Rabbani on Sunday warned of the emergence of a nexus between the US, Israel and India, even as speakers from the parliaments of Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan denounced American policy in the Middle East.

Participants of the first Speakers' Conference, titled 'The Challenges of Terrorism and Inter-Reg­ional Connectivity', issued a joint declaration rejecting 'all unilateral and extra-territorial laws and judicial verdicts by any country against other state, which are in contradiction to international laws, United Nations charter and violate sovereignty and independence of states'.

The declaration singled out the Trump administration's move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

'We condemn any decision and actions, which purported to have altered the character, the status or demographic composition of the holy city of Al Quds, have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with the relevant UN resolutions. We affirm our commitment to Middle East settlement based on international law,' it read.

Warns Washington not to prop up New Delhi as regional 'policeman'; speakers of six parliaments assail US Al Quds move

Highlighting issues such as the continued occupation of Kashmir and the crises in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, the conference vowed to eliminate terrorism in all its forms, with an emphasis on the fight against the militant Islamic State group.

The declaration was signed by Abdul Raouf Ibrahimi, president of the Afghan Wolesi Jirga; Mr Zhangping, vice chairman, Standing Committee of the People's Congress of China; Islamic Consultative Assem­bly of Iran Speaker Dr Ali Ardeshir Larijani; Vyach­eslav V. Volodin, Chairman of the Russian State Duma; Turkish Grand National Assembly Speaker Ismail Kahraman; and National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.

'Not in habit of taking notices'

In his speech, the Senate chairman laid into the recently-announced US National Security Strategy and the statements of US President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

Referring to the latter's allegation that Pakistan had been providing safe havens to terrorists, but had stopped doing so after President Trump 'put it on notice', Mr Rabbani said: 'Pakistan is a sovereign state and is not in the habit of taking notices from anyone, let alone the US.'

He accused the US of pursuing a policy of 'regime change and destabilisation in Muslim countries', particularly in the Middle East. Describing President Trump's decision to shift the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as the 'blunder of all blunders', the Senate chairman said the UN General Assembly had given Washington a befitting reply after over 120 countries voted to reject the move recently.

Mr Rabbani asserted that the US National Security Strategy seemed to be aimed at propping up India. 'We find the US is trying to use or build up India as a policeman of the region,' he noted.

Although Pakistan believes in dialogue and friendly relations with its neighbours, Mr Rabbani said, peace would remain a mirage until New Delhi agreed to treat Islamabad on equal terms.

Speaking on the occasion, President Mamnoon Hussain said Pakistan was dragged into the quagmire of the war on terrorism after the tragic incidents of Sept 11, 2001.

He said terrorism had created immense problems in several countries of the region, with Pakistan being the most severely affected. In the past few years, more than 70,000 Pakistanis had lost their lives, while acts of terrorism had caused financial losses of over $120 billion.

NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq explained how the problems of extremism were being aggravated by the rise of the drug trade. 'Why has the global coalition against terrorism consistently failed to control and destroy poppy cultivation?' he asked.

'Although religious fanaticism has often been cited as the main cause of global terrorism, let us not forget that the rise of the right and the sanctioning of oppression have also added to the mayhem,' he said.

The forum also expressed its commitment to promotion of peace, development and connectivity through China's Belt and Road Initiative, as well as greater people-to-people contact in the realms of 'education, human resource development, innovation and entrepreneurship, cultural exchanges and tourism'.

Dubbed the 'Islamabad Declaration', the joint document concluded on an agree­ment to hold the next such meeting in Iran in 2018.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang said China and Pakistan would look at extending their $57 billion CPEC to Afghanistan, according to news agencies, part of China's ambitious Belt and Road plan linking China with Asia, Europe and beyond.

He said China hoped the economic corridor could benefit the whole region and act as an impetus for development.

'Afghanistan has urgent need to develop and improve people's lives and hopes it can join inter-connectivity initiatives,' Mr Wang told reporters, as he announced that Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to mend their strained relations.

'So China and Pakistan are willing to look at with Afghanistan, on the basis of win-win, mutually beneficial principles, using an appropriate means to extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan,' he added.

How that could happen needs the three countries to reach a gradual consensus, tackling easier, smaller projects first, he said, without giving details.

Khawaja Asif said: 'The successful implementation of CPEC projects will serve as a model for enhancing connectivity and cooperation through similar projects with neighbouring countries, including Afghanistan, Iran and with central and west Asia.'

China has said that its plan to include Afghanistan in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and a recent meeting featuring the three countries does not target a 'third party' and that the project will be beneficial for 'the whole region'.

The inclusion of Afghanistan in the CPEC, which will give China deep access into Central Asia, was portrayed in some media reports as China's cornering of India, but Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying insisted that such a negative perspective was uncalled for, according to a dawn.com report.

'The CPEC targets no third party. Instead, it is expected to benefit third parties and the whole region,' said Ms Hua at a press briefing in Beijing. 'Trilateral dialogue and cooperation does not target any third party and shall be free from any external disruption or disturbance,' she reiterated.

Regarding the CPEC's extension to Afghanistan, the spokesperson explained: 'Afghanistan is an important neighbour to China and Pakistan. It keenly aspires to develop its economy, improve people's livelihood, integrate with the regional connectivity process, and leverage its geographic advantage to connect CPEC with the China Central and Western Asia Economic Corridor.'

Official says CPEC is expected to benefit the whole region

Ms Hua said, 'In order to realise a larger-scale connectivity under the Belt and Road framework, the three parties agreed to identify concrete cooperation projects through equal-footed consultations to achieve common development and security as well as regional peace and stability.'

Earlier this week, foreign ministers of Pakistan, China and Afghanistan met in Beijing as part of Chinese President Xi Jinping 's initiative to strengthen ties and develop cooperation between the three countries.

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that Bank of China (BoC) will play its due role not only in the economic development of Pakistan, but also in strengthening bilateral trade and banking relationships.

Addressing a celebration ceremony organised by the BoC on Friday, Mr Shah appreciated the Chinese bank for successful launching of its operations in Pakistan.

He said Pakistan is a significant country in South Asia as well as the sixth-most populous country in the world. As early as 1942, BoC had opened up the southwest international channel, and established branches in Pakistan which remained operational till 1970.

Mr Shah recalled that in 2013, President of The Peoples Republic of China, Xi Jinping launched the One-Belt One-Road (OBOR) initiative. 'The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a flagship project of this initiative,' he said and added this project includes substantial cooperation and has huge untapped potential.

He said as BoC is a key partner in OBOR we expect that it will be able to effectively cater to the financing needs of CPEC projects by leveraging its specialised services and expertise.

BoC opened its first branch in Karachi on Nov 7.

'Opening of BoC branch in Pakistan marked the confidence of Chinese corporate sector in Pakistan's economic situation,' he hoped.

The chief minister said that the future of China and Pakistan's economic cooperation is very bright; more so in the wake of sustained improvement in Pakistan's GDP growth resulting in growing investor confidence. 'Monetary easing, stable prices, better availability of energy, and improved law and order conditions have created an enabling macroeconomic environment,' he said.

Mr Shah said the Government of Pakistan is taking utmost responsibility to ensure the protection, safety and provide a favourable work environment to Chinese enterprises. 'We will actively serve Chinese enterprises to invest in Pakistan, help the implementation of projects in the CPEC, and fully support the economic development of Pakistan,' he observed.

Islamabad to continue engagement with Washington: Janjua

Foreign Se­cre­tary Tehmina Janjua has said that Pakistan will continue to have engagement, as far as possible, with the US because America is not only a global power but also has its presence in the region, and 'for us it's almost our neighbour'.

Delivering a lecture on 'Pakistan's Foreign Policy Issues' at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) here on Saturday, she said: 'We need to continue to have a measured response to all the rhetoric coming out of the US.'

In reply to a question, the foreign secretary said President Donald Trump's tweet on Jan 1 could be well thought out or he was just being his impulsive self, or it could be a result of any other reason such as the fact that the US is not doing well in Afghanistan.

Says Foreign Office officials need to come out of the building and talk to people

Giving her reasons for speaking at IBA, Ms Janjua said at the outset that the Foreign Office needed to come out of its building and talk to the people. Then she remarked, 'I put my foot in the mouth when I decided to come [here] today, especially when Mr Trump put his foot in the mouth when he sent out that tweet.'

She began her presentation by highlighting the objectives of Pakistan's foreign policy.

Talking about the global and regional environment, she pointed out that 'America first' was the slogan that came up with Mr Trump coming to power... At that point Ms Janjua commented, 'The tweet that came on Jan 1 was a tweet that came for many reasons. We are trying to analyse why that tweet came. It could have been some briefing material given to him in the morning… What triggered it? Because we mustn't forget that the meetings we had with the Americans (General Mattis) before that were positive… Yet on Jan 1 the New Year's gift to the world were two tweets: there was one about Pakistan and the other about Iran. Why was the president of the United States at four o'clock in the morning thinking about Pakistan and Iran? In Iran, there was something happening there, but Pakistan, [a] question mark.'

She said Pakistan's concerns were highlighted in the cabinet's national security committee. They were: security provider role given to India in our region; border management issues; the US National Security Strategy, 2017, which wasn't positive. But, she said, this was all a pattern with the US South Asia policy.

The foreign secretary said one of the reasons for the situation was the rise of China as an economic and military power perceived as the challenger to the US dominance.

She said in Afghanistan the India-US nexus was very much there. There were ungoverned spaces in Afghanistan, so when they talked about 'sanctuaries in Pakistan, we'd been telling our American friends that as far as Pakistan is concerned there is no organised presence of the Haqqani network. And if you have any information, through intelligence sharing we can address this issue'. On the contrary, she argued, Pakistan had expressed concern over the sanctuaries in Afghanistan that were being used by anti-Pakistan groups.

With respect to the Middle East, Ms Janjua said Pakistan's challenge was to find a balance with its friends in the Gulf region.

'We are very satisfied with the relations we have with Russia.'

Highlighting the opportunities that Pakistan had, the foreign secretary said it was to increase regional and global connectivity along with its membership of regional organisations.

She said current focus of Pakistan's foreign policy was on having a strategic partnership with China; continue promoting peace with Afghanistan; return of Afghan refugees with dignity; focus on border management with Afghanistan; maintaining principled position for a comprehensive dialogue with India, etc.

She said Pakistan was China's partner in the Belt and Road Initiative. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor was a pathway to industrial development in Pakistan, she added.

Answering a question on Pakistan being put by the US on watch list for violation of religious freedom, Ms Janjua said it had political reasons because right next door [in India] mob lynching of Muslims and minorities took place but no one took notice of it.


 
 

Tweets and consequences

THE insult contained in President Trump's new year tweet accusing Pakistan of 'lies and deceit' was followed by announcement of the injury the $255 million cut in Foreign Military Financing by the Indian-origin US ambassador to the UN. Further punitive measures may be revealed shortly. These are the latest developments in the progressively unravelling Pakistan-US relationship.

Pakistan is the world's fifth largest country; it fields one of the most powerful militaries; it is a nuclear weapons state. It has its own priorities and interests in the region. It cannot be threatened and pushed around like a banana republic.

Pakistan needs to articulate its interests and objectives, and execute its policies, boldly and clearly. The rambling statement issued by the National Security Council meeting in Islamabad did not adequately respond to the American insult or injury. It was left to the statement issued by the PTI leader, Imran Khan, to express the anger and sentiments of the Pakistani people.

Pakistan needs to boldly and clearly articulate its interests and objectives to the US.

If it has not already done so, Pakistan should tell the US clearly and boldly that: one, we expect the Afghan and coalition forces to halt all cross-border attacks against Pakistan from Afghanistan. These attacks are emanating from 'safe havens' which the TTP, Jamaatul Ahrar (JuA) and IS terrorists enjoy in the 40pc of Afghanistan's territory which is ungoverned; two, Pakistan will encourage the Afghan Taliban, whose fighters, commanders and leaders are in Afghanistan, to engage in political dialogue with the National Unity Government in Kabul. They are likely to respond to political incentives, not the escalation of force; three, Pakistan will not kill or capture Afghan Taliban leaders who happen to be on Pakistani territory as long as they are not involved in cross-border attacks or terrorism on or from Pakistani territory. To expel them, we will have to expel all the Afghan refugees; four, Pakistan sympathises with the legitimate aspirations of the Kashmiri people. It will act against all militant groups on Pakistan territory, including the pro-Kashmiri groups, but only in accordance with its obligations under UN Security Council resolutions, nothing more or less; and, five, Pakistan will discuss restraints on its nuclear and missile programmes, with the US or in any other format, only if these discussions involve reciprocal restraints by India.

Pakistan should make a clear policy decision not to accept US financial assistance or the so-called reimbursement from the Coalition Support Fund. So long as Islamabad accepts US money, it will be treated as a 'gun for hire'. If money is to be extracted from the US, it should be in the form of high fees for the transit of goods for its forces in Afghanistan that are presently allowed to flow free of charge through or over Pakistan.

However, Pakistan should review its agreement to allow this land and air supply to US-Nato forces in Afghanistan. What is the rationale for facilitating supplies to forces that could, one day, perhaps sooner than expected, pose a threat to Pakistan's security?

Indeed, there are now good reasons for Pakistan, and other regional states (China, Russia, Iran, Turkey and the Central Asians), to consider ways to secure the early departure of US and Nato forces from Afghanistan. The Trump administration has opted for an escalation of force in Afghanistan. It wants to stay there indefinitely to project power in the region. This is a recipe for perpetual war. The Taliban will not accept a settlement that omits the exit of foreign forces from Afghanistan. Nor can they be defeated militarily.

Second, the US has obviously not 'done enough' to eliminate the TTP, JuA, IS and affiliated terrorist groups which conduct cross-border attacks on Pakistan from their Afghan 'safe havens'. It is plausible that the US has endorsed Indian-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan, perhaps to disrupt the CPEC project.

Third, the US has reportedly formulated plans to 'seize or destroy' Pakistan's nuclear capabilities in a crisis. Obviously, its special forces in Afghanistan are likely to be used for this purpose.

Fourth, Russia and Iran are openly suspicious of the US relationship with IS/Daesh. It is strange that IS has emerged in Afghanistan under America's watch. It could spread from Afghanistan to neighbouring countries. It requires a collective effort, including Afghan Taliban cooperation, to eliminate this virulent brand of terrorism.

Given the US reluctance to promote a political solution, the regional states should assume the responsibility of doing so. They should contact and cooperate with all willing Afghan parties and groups to evolve the parameters for a possible political solution to the conflict in Afghanistan. There are several formats available to conduct such a peace process, with or without US cooperation.

In this context, Pakistan needs to review the nature of its relationships in Afghanistan. It should open and maintain contacts with all relevant parties in Afghanistan, including Kabul and the Afghan Taliban. It should build new ties with the various warlords. It should adopt a differentiated approach to the Afghan refugees, supporting those who are friendly and need Pakistan's help, externing those who abuse Pakistan or collaborate with India.

A strong response to the US attempts to bully Pakistan would reflect the sentiments of the vast majority of the Pakistani people, from the liberal elite to the religious extremists. Pakistan may suffer financially and face immense diplomatic pressure. We have endured and emerged stronger from past bouts of US-led sanctions.

In any case, from a strategic perspective, a Pakistan-US alliance has become unsustainable. The US is aligned with our enemy, India, and opposed to the rise of our strategic partner, China, including the Belt and Road Initiative and CPEC. It supports India's campaign to crush the Kashmiri struggle for freedom. It has recognised Holy Jerusalem (Al Quds al Sharif) as Israel's capital thus foreclosing the establishment of a viable Palestinian State. It is supporting instability in Iran. It is pushing Saudi Arabia into an alliance with Israel and confrontation with Iran. For all these reasons, it would be best to work out ways for an amicable separation with Trump's America.


 
 

 China  issues sweeping guidelines to push yuan for  Belt and Road  business

The People's Bank of China (PBC) has announced a raft of new measures to push a greater cross-border role for the yuan that aim to 'contribute to opening up on all fronts'.

The measures go far beyond yuan settlement of cross-border trade. In a notice posted on its website, the PBC lists five seperate measures to be pursued. The list is reproduced below.

First, all cross-border business allowed by the law to be settled with foreign exchange can also be settled with RMB by enterprises. Following the principle of serving the real economy and facilitating trade and investment, banks are encouraged to develop new financial products based on current cross-border RMB business policies, in order to improve their capacity in providing financial services, and meet market players' real and legitimate demands for cross-border RMB business.

Employee compensation, remittance of profits, dividends and 'other returns' to investment can be in yuan for BRI investments

Second, to serve the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and meet the demands for cross-border RMB settlement in employee compensation, social welfare, and allowance for family remittance in individual accounts, banks can provide individuals with cross-border payment services under other current account items. This will make it easier for domestic individuals to remit their legitimate income from overseas, and vice versa.

Third, to promote green development, the Notice proposes specific rules for cross-border RMB settlement on carbon emission trading by overseas investors.

Fourth, direct RMB investments by overseas investors are made much easier. The Notice further optimises relevant procedures, eliminates limitations on relevant account opening and payments, and clearly permits banks to provide relevant services to meet enterprises' actual demands following the three basic principles of doing business. The Notice requires banks to ensure the free remittance of RMB profits, dividends, and other investment returns of overseas investors.

Fifth, the RMB funds raised by domestic enterprises through issuing bonds or shares overseas can be transferred back to China whenever necessary, thus simplifying the relevant procedures and daily operations of the enterprises.

Since the pilot programmes for RMB settlements in cross-border trade were launched in 29, based on market-oriented principles, the PBC has been constantly pursuing policies on cross-border RMB business to meet market players' needs, facilitate their cross-border trade and investment so as to avoid foreign exchange risks and reduce financial costs.

Police arrested four Chinese nationals for illegally drawing cash from automated teller machines (ATMs) in Defence Housing Authority and Bahadurabad and seized a huge quantity of money and ATM cards from them while their five other accomplices escaped on Sunday.

Officials of the police and the Federal Investigation Agency described the Chinese nationals as members of 'an organised gang', which had stolen 'millions of rupees' from the city.

The DHA police early on Sunday morning received information that about five Chinese men were doing some suspicious activities at an ATM in Phase-II, said Clifton SP Dr Assad Malhi.

The police party rushed to the spot after receiving information and managed to arrest three Chinese while their two accomplices fled, added the officer.

Speaking at a press conference and later talking with Dawn, the Clifton SP said that the police recovered Rs2.3 million, 350 master cards of ATM, which were being used to steal money.

During the initial probe, the held Chinese revealed that they came to Karachi on Jan 11 on a business trip.

The SP claimed that the held foreigners appeared to be a part of an 'organised gang' of Chinese nationals who had stolen 'millions of rupees' from ATMs.

They told the investigators that this gang hired young men in China to steal cash from ATMs and they were being paid Rs150,000 a month.

In another incident in Bahadurabad, one more Chinese national was arrested, said Karachi-East SSP Dr Samiullah Soomro.

The officer said that the police received a call on Madadgar-15 at around 0615 hours regarding suspected Chinese nationals skimming ATMs of Summit Bank and MCB Bank at Shabbirabad and on Tipu Sultan Road.

'The police party responded within 10 minutes and managed to arrest one Chinese national namely Xu Zhuping and recovered Rs650,000, various amounts of Chinese currency, ATM skimming devices, his ID card and passport and his mobile phone,' said the SSP.

Three suspects escaped in a vehicle.

'CCTV footage is being obtained and further investigation is ongoing,' added the SSP East.

Subsequently, four arrested Chinese nationals were handed over to the FIA for further legal action, said its director of Sindh zone Dr Amir Ahmed Shaikh.

Talking to Dawn the FIA Sindh director said that during past 10 days, six Chinese had been arrested red-handed by police and the FIA.

Sharing initial findings, Dr Shaikh said that two Chinese nationals were arrested on January 10 from HBL on main Abdullah Haroon Road branch near Zainab Market and a case was registered against them.

The FIA seized one ATM skimming machine, some blank ATM cards, one spying camera, one memory card and one MSR machine for fake ATM creation from their possession.

The FIA Sindh head said one USB and some bank ATM cards were also seized from the suspect who was arrested in Bahadurabad while Pakistani currency and blank ATM cards were also recovered from three Chinese who were arrested in Defence.

'With the support of interpreters of Chinese language, further raids are being planned to arrest their accomplices on information of held foreigners,' revealed Dr. Shaikh.


 
 

Everything comes at a price, even a stable rupee

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is fire-fighting on the forex front knowing well that it is now paying the price for keeping the rupee overvalued in the past.

The tragedy is that the decision to let the rupee put on extra weight was not entirely the central bank's. In fact, the government of Mian Nawaz Sharif with Ishaq Dar at the finance helm never 'allowed' the SBP to independently manage the exchange rate.

In July 2017, when Mr Dar forced the SBP to withdraw its decision of correcting the exchange rate, all came to know who wanted to stretch the duration of the rupee overvaluation.

'But even before that whenever the central bank wanted to let the rupee shed some value, the government resisted the move,' recalls a senior central banker.

Currently, the central bank's forex reserves are quite low (slightly below $14bn as on Jan 5, insufficient to cover even three months of imports).

Speaking analogically, the SBP does not have enough water to spray on the flames of uncertainty that engulf the rupee. Besides, the SBP's writ, or in our analogue the fire engines, cannot manoeuvre the entire labyrinth of the open market where the smouldering debris sits.

In inter-bank market too, the SBP's ambitious fire fighting cannot permit it to supply dollars too generously: there are limitations of low forex reserves along with some market rules.

One of the rules is that the central bank cannot be a net supplier of foreign exchange all the time. That would raise a question in the market over claims of even a quasi-free exchange rate regime.

Speaking analogically, the SBP does not have enough water to spray on the flames of uncertainty that engulf the rupee

Once we keep this detailed view of the exchange rate fire fighting in mind, it becomes easier for us to understand why occasionally the central bank has to eat its words. Just a few days after imposing an otherwise sensible restriction on forex companies, the SBP had to lift it.

The central bank had initially asked these companies to bring back home physical cash equivalent in US dollars only up to 35 per cent of the sales of non-dollar foreign currencies (Euro, Pound Sterling, Saudi Riyal and UAE Dirham) in Dubai.

It had told them to repatriate the remaining 65pc via bank accounts. But within days, it reversed the move and re-permitted up to100pc repatriation in physical cash dollars. The SBP had to do this as the 35pc condition had, according to forex companies, created so much shortage of dollars in the open market that they were unable to transact business.

Obviously, the open market rates also shot up to unmanageable heights widening the gap between these and interbank rates, at one point around Rs2 per US dollar.

After the reversal of the SBP restriction, the US dollar rate in the open market started falling and the wedge between the interbank and open market rates narrowed to Rs1.50 per dollar within three days.

Officials of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan hope that the gap between the two rates would narrow further to Re1 per dollar within a couple of days.

So, now we know that if SBP wants to keep exchange rates stable in the open market, the only way is to let forex companies bring back home physical cash dollars equivalent to full proceeds of the sales of non-dollar foreign currencies in Dubai.

'This means one source of cash outflow of non-dollar foreign currencies and inflow of cash dollars would remain open to misdeclaration,' remarked a source close to the SBP.

Customs authorities at airports and officials of the SBP and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) keep a check on physical movement of foreign currencies by forex companies. That would continue. Why then would the SBP impose the 35pc import of dollars against export of non-dollar foreign currencies condition in the first place?

'There is more to it than meets the eye,' commented a source close to the central bank.

'The SBP's restriction (announced on Jan 1 and withdrawn on Jan 9) had a noble motive i.e. to make misdeclaration difficult by involving banks in handling 65pc import of dollars against export of non-dollar foreign currencies.

'But this does not suit the interests of the very big, very powerful people involved in currency money laundering, currency smuggling and capital flight,' says a former head of a foreign bank.

'And it is easier for them to manipulate dollar supplies in the open market for a few days to create noise and an impression that a certain decision of the central bank is behind this shortage. The rest follows according to their plan.

'The federal government refuses to listen to the SBP logic and keeps demanding that the open market rates be brought to normal levels and finally the central bank is left with no option but to retract even an otherwise right decision.'

GOING FORWARD: Exchange rate management is expected to remain tough for the SBP throughout this fiscal year.

First, despite improvements in exports and home remittances, filling in the big hole in the current account balance ($6.43bn in five months of FY18) might tempt the central bank to let the rupee fall further.

But letting this happen would not be that easy because fiscal authorities would resist it to avoid a build-up in the rupee cost of foreign debt servicing; that to in the last year of the PML-N term, senior bankers say.

The pressure on the rupee, meanwhile, would abate. Despite deceleration in growth rate, the volume of imports remain huge (about $29bn in 1st half of FY18) and despite a rise in growth rate, export volume is still low ($11bn 1st half of FY18).

Assuming that this pattern continues through the second half, import dollar demand alone might be too strong, to talk about foreign debt servicing and outward remittances of dollars by foreign companies in Pakistan.

'And, banks and importers will take time to get used to a planned use of the yuan instead of the US dollar for financing imports from China.

YUAN COMING: However, with the most recent move by China on Jan 11 to push the use of yuan for its Belt and Road Initiative, of which CPEC is an offshoot, the dream of Pak-China trade in bilateral currencies may come true sooner rather than later.

The People's Bank of China issued a notice on its website on Jan 11 proposing five measures, all meant to promote the use of yuan for cross-border trade and investment for Chinese companies.

'After studying those measures, the SBP can issue further guidelines to banks here and show them ways for promoting Pak-China trade in bilateral currencies, and even ways for attracting Chinese investment in yuan instead of dollars,' speculated the treasury head of a local bank.

'In that case, the demand for dollars might not be as strong as we thought earlier (before the announcement of the new measures by Chinese central bank for promoting Yuan. But again, it all depends on how soon these things materialise.'


 
 

Pakistan seeks US aid for refugees' return, says Ahsan Iqbal

Pakistan asked the United States on Friday to provide an economic package for honourable return of three million Afghan refugees to their homeland instead of indulging in blame game.

Talking to journalists, Minister for Interior and Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal said Pakistan could not be expected to certify who among the 3m Afghan refugees were peaceful or involved in cross-border terrorism. He said Pakistan could only guarantee having no terrorists on its soil when it did not have to look after foreign refugees who also had relationships across the border.

He said the US had withdrawn after the cold war and left Pakistan in the lurch. They should now share the responsibility instead of blaming Pakistan for its difficulties, he said, adding that the 'US should now announce economic package for return of 3m Afghan refugees' to their homeland.

'In the presence of 3m Afghans living in the country, Pakistan cannot certify who among the Afghans are involved in terrorist activities. It's time for the US to do more in partnership with other stakeholders, otherwise if we are engaged in blame game then terrorists will get benefit,' Mr Iqbal said.

In response to a question about growing ties between the US, India and Israel, he said new alignments were being made in the world, but 'we don't need to be worry as we also have other foreign policy options'.

Minister says Islamabad cannot certify who among 3m Afghans were involved in terrorist activities

'We should settle all domestic issues and ensure political stability; only peace and stability can take us forward instead of indulging in confrontation,' he added.

The minister said some neighbours were making conspiracies against the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) because they were not happy with the new central position Pakistan was going to secure after developments under the CPEC and opening up of Central Asia, South Asia and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). He said India should get rid of its narrow approach as these would benefit the whole region.

Speaking about Gwadar development, Mr Iqbal said no special treatment was given to China with regard to the Gwadar port, adding that the agreement Pakistan had signed with the Singapore Port Authority more than a decade ago but could not induce investment for its development was transferred to the China Overseas Port Holding Company on the same terms and conditions which had actualised the project development.

Within a short span of five to six months, the Gwadar Business Centre had been built which was the largest facility in Balochistan, he said, adding that Chinese companies were moving quickly for infrastructure development.

The minister said that around $4 billion investment had been made in Gwadar in the first phase to energise or complete different projects, including port, basic infrastructure and free economic zone.

He said that initially China committed $800 million out of total $46bn under the CPEC for development of Gwadar, adding that for the second phase, $3-4bn investment had been mobilised cumulatively by the federal and Balochistan governments as well as the private sectors of both China and Pakistan, which would translate Gwadar into gateway for the CPEC.

Gwadar Port Authority Chairman Dostain Khan Jamaldini said China had so far invested $2bn in Gwadar's infrastructure, energy, transport and industrial sectors. Separately, he added, local expenditure on Gwadar had significantly increased to Rs36bn from Rs3.5bn in 2013.

Responding to questions about water crisis in Gwadar, Mr Jamaldini said the town's water requirement stood at six million gallons per day (MGD), but two small dams were currently providing around 2.7 MGD. The requirement would rise to 12 MGD for which additional arrangements were being made to get 10 MGD, he added.

He said that about 2,000 locals and 500 Chinese were working on projects in Gwa­dar. About future expansion in Gwadar, he said the free economic zone would spread over 2,200 acres for which five industries steel, automobile, marine, fish and oil had been granted permission to install their units. 'We have received another 300 applications for trade and industrial complexes, including banks and insurance companies.'

Window to the West

WHEN in 1960 Mao Zedong sent off General Gengbiao, his second ambassador to Pakistan, he reportedly advised him: 'Look after Pakistan; it is China's window to the West'.

Mao's depiction may have been as much metaphorical as geographical. During the 1960s, Pakistan was China's diplomatic window to the West, eventually brokering the normalisation of China-US relations in 1971. Today, the physical facet of Mao's depiction is becoming a reality in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Gen Gengbiao, who went on to become China's defence minister and deputy prime minister, played a vital role in building the China-Pakistan strategic relationship. So did Pakistan's prime minister Bogra and foreign minister, and later prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

Unfortunately, large swathes of the Pakistani pub­­lic, especially the youth, are not fully aware of the history, intensity and rationale of the Pakistan-China relationship. Some Western-oriented Pakis­ta­­nis even question China's desire for a strong Pakistan.

Pakistan and China must undertake serious efforts to preserve, diversify and intensify their relationship.

The Pakistan-China relationship has survived the twists and turns of global politics and domestic changes in both countries because it is based on a strong and lasting alignment of their national interests.

Over the last five decades, Pakistan has boldly defended China's unity and territorial integrity; worked assiduously to secure China's legitimate seat in the United Nations; resisted attempts to censure China on human rights and to denigrate its socioeconomic achievements.

For its part, China has and continues to manifest its support for Pakistan in multiple ways.

In 1965, China moved its troops to its disputed border with India, preventing India from redeploying additional forces to the battlefield against Pakistan;

In 1971, as India invaded East Pakistan, China defended Pakistan's territorial integrity and was prepared to respond to Pakistan's call to intervene militarily but was prevented from doing so by an explicit Soviet nuclear threat;

In 1972, at Pakistan's request, China vetoed the admission of Bangladesh into the United Nations until Dhaka and Delhi agreed to release the 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war;

China built Pakistan's heavy industrial complex at Taxila and other manufacturing capabilities virtually on a grant basis;

Despite US pressure and sanctions, China supplied Pakistan with its first ballistic missiles and enabled it to develop its now formidable missile capabilities;

China remains the only country willing to sell civilian nuclear reactors to Pakistan and has blocked India's single entry into the Nuclear Suppliers' Group;

For over three decades, new Chinese military equipment was made available to Pakistan almost simultaneously with its induction in the PLA;

China was the only country to agree to the co-production of advanced military aircraft and other weapons systems with Pakistan;

As China's economic fortunes improved, it quietly and repeatedly extended financial support (loans, bank deposits, grants) to enable Pakistan to meet economic emergencies and bolster its failing finances;

China decided to finance the CPEC projects in Pakistan as the first leg of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. No other country's companies were prepared to invest or work in Pakistan;

Finally, as India pursues a global media and diplomatic campaign to 'isolate' Pakistan and threatens 'surgical strikes' and a 'limited war', and as the US exerts pressure on Pakistan to support its failed strategy in Afghanistan and succumb to Indian diktat, it is China, with its veto in the Security Council and influence in major capitals, that stands in the way of negative international decisions and actions against Pakistan.

In the currently unfolding Asian drama, the power relationships in South Asia and adjacent areas will depend on the structure and content of Sino-US, Sino-India and Pakistan-India relations.

The US has designated China as a 'competitor' in its recent national security document. President Trump is reportedly 'frustrated' by China's 'failure' to persuade or punish North Korea or to reduce the US trade deficit with China. Trade action against China appears to be in the offing. There is revived rhetoric from the Pentagon regarding 'freedom of navigation' in the South China Sea. The US endeavours to build alliances around China's periphery are active.

To dampen the US campaign, China appears to have softened its stance towards the states with which it has maritime disputes in the South China Sea as well as with its main Asian rivals: Japan and India. For instance, in the Donglan (Doklam) stand-off, China allowed New Delhi to save face by not publicising India's troop withdrawal and it accepted a mention of UN-listed 'terrorist' organisations in the BRICS Summit communiqué.

Obviously, Beijing does not want India to enter into an alliance with the US against China. Its tactical diplomacy may serve to defer critical strategic choices. Yet, it is evident that Trump and his generals are on a path towards an open military and strategic confrontation with China. India will, if it has not done so already, embrace a military alliance with the US. India sees itself as China's 'natural' rival; it hungers for China's great power status; the 1962 defeat still rankles; the border disputes with China have not been resolved. A powerful, anti-Muslim, anti-Chinese, 'democratic' America is viewed in Modi's Delhi as a 'natural ally'.

In this configuration, Pakistan has no choice but to preserve and intensify its strategic partnership with China. The alternative is submission to a Pax Indo-Americana.

Despite their long and close partnership, Pakistan and China need to undertake urgent and serious efforts to preserve, diversify and intensify their relationship. These efforts include: suppression of terrorist groups, like the ETIM, which threaten China's security; prevention of externally sponsored disruption of CPEC, especially in Gilgit-Baltistan (CPEC's 'chicken neck') and Balochistan; efficient execution of CPEC projects; focused and generous Chinese support for Pakistan's economic and industrial modernisation; promotion of peace in Afghanistan to end the US presence there; a joint stance against India's anti-Pakistan threats; and the rapid modernisation of Pakistan's armed forces and their strategic and tactical integration with the PLA.

Naturally, both China and Pakistan will continue to hope that America's present omni-directional belligerence will give way, perhaps in a post-Trump era, to more astute, responsible policies. To that day, Pakistan and China should keep open their window to the West.


 
 

Chinese influence outpaces influx

No one denies a surge in Chinese nationals in Pakistan post CPEC but the perception of the influx far exceeds the reality. For Pakistani businessmen grown on Western ways, the inrush turned out to be challenging.

In a sharp contrast to the projected 400,000 Chinese in Pakistan, the actual presence, according to officials in the planning and interior ministries, is around 60,000. The biggest concentration was said to be in Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore.

According to relevant sources in Islamabad, there were about 20,000 Chinese living in Pakistan before 2013. These included Chinese nationals engaged in public projects in mining and energy, such as Saindak, nuclear energy plants, etc. Other businesses where Chinese had visible presence included grooming, dental care and restaurants.

Five years back in 2013 when Pakistan and China launched CPEC there was some scepticism in business circles but the market was mostly optimistic.

It was read by many as the first serious signal of revised economic diplomacy and a sign of readjustment to the changing geopolitical situation. Pakistan clearly committed itself to China's 'One Belt One Road' vision to revive its own flagging economy.

There were several other factors that converged but there is little denying the fact that the change paid off and the Pakistani economy did recover. As a matter of fact GDP growth has been gaining momentum since. From 3.6pc in 2013 growth surged to over 5.5pc in 2017 and is expected to be over 6pc during the ongoing fiscal year.

The market of construction-related materials, including cement, improved significantly but businesses counting on ready gains with the arrival of the very first wave of Chinese were disappointed. The expansion in the hospitality and allied sectors (hotels, guest houses, rent a car/taxi and airlines) was said to be less than expected.

To their surprise Chinese visitors proved to be different. Unlike Westerners the guests from the East were found to be hard bargainers, holding their purse strings by their teeth.

'Yes, our occupancy level did improve. The number of live-in guests, dinners and hall booking for business meetings shot up. The rise, however, is a fraction of what we anticipated', the managing director of a five-star hotel said on condition of anonymity.

'Even top Chinese executives, here for a few months, book hotel rooms for merely days. They pounce on the first opportunity of a more economical option.'

'Chinese companies build workers colonies at breakneck speed near project sites. They add a few VIP houses in every colony to cut on their budget of hosting consultants', lamented a hotel owner.

Lashley Pulsipher, Chief Marketing Sales and Revenue Officer, Hashoo Group, (owners of Pearl Continental Chain of hotels in Pakistan), was diplomatic. She responded to a Dawn query thus: 'While we haven't seen a surge in business that we can relate specifically to CPEC, the occupancy rates in our hotels continue to grow every year. The economic optimism that was boosted by CPEC has had a positive impact on our businesses and we see that trend continuing as long as the country remains stable and secure'.

The group has hotels near Chinese project sites at Muzaffarabad and Gwadar besides in other major cities.

Government officials were particularly cautious. Many corporate executives were also reluctant to go on record on the subject. Sources in the Ministry of Interior said that Chinese presence in the country has increased about fourfold but the majority is that of short-term visitors.

A high-ranking official at the Planning Commission mentioned and shared the results of a survey carried out in November 2017 by the ministry to calm what it called 'misplaced concerns' about the job market in the wake of CPEC.

The said survey revealed that all CPEC related projects collectively engage 28,000 people at varied levels. About 30pc (7,000) of the workforce was Chinese the rest 21,000 were occupied by locals.

'To ensure the early completion of projects in the energy and logistic sector, the Pakistan government opted for EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) mode in the deal.

'This meant that we had to forego the control on the employment policy in exchange for the company being responsible for any cost overrun in case of delay,' a senior member of the government's economic team said by phone from Islamabad.

The media coordinator of the Ministry of Interior did not confirm issuance of 27,000 visas to Chinese in 2016 or disclosed the total number of visas issued in 2017. An insider said that the number of visas actually fell somewhat in 2017 without quoting a number. He attributed it to the political uncertainty and higher risk perception last year.

Dr Nadeem Javed, chief economist at the Planning Commission, saw the interest of private Chinese companies in Pakistan picking up as closer government to government ties manifest in tangible progress on CPEC projects.

'There is a visible spike in the two-way traffic between the two nations to a point where we are discussing proposals to facilitate visitors by revising visa policies and information sharing, exploring options to increase the number of weekly flights and destinations', he said.

When reached over phone Mashood Tajwar, spokesperson PIA, was caught unawares. 'If the Chinese desire a greater access for their airlines it is up to the Civil Aviation Authority to decide. PIA, at one point, had three flights but currently operates two flights from Islamabad to Beijing. Yes, we have fleet limitation issues, but the decision ultimately depends on the economic viability of a rout'.

'The number of flights can increase but the access to more cities will be difficult as PIA lacks the capacity to avail the facility.

Offering unilateral access to Chinese airlines will not be acceptable', said an expert in know of things.

Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Sunday inaugurated the 38km-long Lyari Expressway and expressed the hope that the project's completion would help improve transport facilities in Karachi to a great extent.

He said there were many hurdles, including removal of encroachments, in the way of the expressway and as a result its cost went up from Rs5.5 billion to Rs10bn.

The Lyari Expressway project was launched in May 2002 and the National Highway Authority had expected to complete it in 30 months that was in November 2004. But work on the project remained suspended for years, sometimes due to lack of funding and sometimes due to relevant authorities' inability to remove encouragements around Lyari River.

With four interchanges at Sohrab Goth, Manghopir, Sir Shah Suleman and Maripur, Lyari Expressway has 20 major bridges. The expressway will not only significantly improve the flow of traffic in Karachi, but it will also help reduce flood damage to areas along the river.

Says general elections will be held in July

Mr Abbasi said that the motorway was also in the last phase of its completion which would help stabilise the country's economy.

He said that the development package announced by the federal government for Karachi would yield positive results in short as well as long term.

The prime minister said that the general elections in the country would be held in July and the party having mandate of people would form the next government.

'There is a need for continuity of democracy for the progress of the country and policies should remain over and above politics,' he said.

Mr Abbasi said that with the completion of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor the region along with Pakistan would make progress.

He said Central Asian countries and Afghanistan were keenly witnessing the completion of the CPEC which was part of the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road signature project. He expressed the hope that CPEC projects would generate vast job opportunities.


 
 

 China 's development push worries non-profits

CHINA'S development push into poor countries is marginalising the role of human rights bodies, green groups and other non-profits, making it harder for them to play their traditional role as a check on rampant development, advocates said.

China has embarked on one of the biggest overseas development plans since America's post-war Marshall Plan, with more than $100 billion of investments through its Belt and Road scheme to build highways, rail lines, ports and other infrastructure linking up Asia, Europe and Africa.

But unlike Western-backed lenders, where development financing often comes with social and environmental strings and strengthens the voice of non-profits, China-backed lenders are taking a more hands-off approach, according to interviews with NGO executives and a lender at the World Economic Forum.

'The situation with China right now is obviously the one to watch,' said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. 'What are the standards they are setting in the loans or the financing that they are doing around the world?'

Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, described China's approach as amoral and said it had eased the economic pressure that nations felt when aid or investment was 'more conditioned on respect for human rights'.

Beijing-backed institutions take a different approach to the World Bank and other Western-backed development lenders

China-backed institutions take a different approach to the World Bank and other Western-backed development lenders.

For example, the World Bank has a strong bias against new coal-fired power stations on environmental grounds, but China's new Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which is helping finance the Belt and Road plan, is less strident.

The AIIB's vice president for policy and strategy, Joachim von Amsberg, told Reuters at Davos that the Chinese-backed lender wanted to encourage transition to renewable energy but it did not want to 'put on the front door the sign 'No Coal'.'

'We are not seeing every project as a lever into broader policy changes in our member countries,' von Amsberg said. 'That is a welcome addition to the world of development finance because I think it avoids the risk of overreaching, of trying to do too much with individual investment projects.'

Financing through institutions such as the World Bank has long been used by rich countries as a way to push borrowers to improve their track record on social causes.

As part of that push, non-profits have played the role of watchdogs, helping to change the course on issues such as dam development and speaking up for human rights.

Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has asked the Balochistan government to develop plans for development of coastal areas and held out the assurance that the federal government would extend all cooperation in this regard.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of Gwadar Expo on Monday, he said no port could be functional without establishing a free zone.

The two-day expo has been jointly organised by the Gwadar Development Authority and China Overseas Ports Holding Company that would provide a platform for interaction between local and foreign private sectors and government officials for investment opportunities.

Mr Abbasi said that 'Free Zone' was an integral part of Gwadar port and the project would pave the way for speedy development of Balochistan and would provide ample job opportunities in the province.

The prime minister said the future of Balochistan was in the hands of political leadership and it was the duty of the Balochistan government to find out the solution of people's problems and meet the challenges itself.

He announced 'Equalisation Package' for Balochistan, under which the federal government would share half the development cost in every district of the province, including establishment of hospitals, education and other facilities.

'The Equalisation Package will ensure the provision of equal facilities in all districts of the province to achieve the target of sustainable development goals,' Mr Abbasi said.

He said this was perhaps the most important initiative of our generation and the most visible part of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Mr Abbasi said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would prove to be a game-changer not only for Pakistan but also the entire region and it would bring prosperity.

He said the future of Balochistan was in the hands of its elected leaders.

'Political leaders of the province have to resolve their issues themselves, otherwise they will never be solved,' the premier implored.

Mr Abbasi said the motorways and highways were linking Gwadar to Khunjerab which linked Peshawar to Karachi.

He said modernisation of the railway system, establishment of power projects…and special economic zones would generate employment.

He said the CPEC was a project of common development and prosperity.

Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing reaffirmed to support progress and prosperity in Pakistan. He said the Chinese businessmen would continue to invest in developmental projects of Gwadar.

He said the CPEC was a proof of everlasting friendship between China and Pakistan and it 'is the most important initiative of our generation'.

Chairman of the China Overseas Ports Holding Company Mr Zhang said development of Gwadar would help improve the overall economic conditions in Pakistanis and also of local people.

He said for the construction of Gwadar Free Zone, China had employed around 2,000 local people keeping in view their involvement in the mega project.

Chief Minister Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo in his speech stressed the need for giving more importance to the well-being and welfare of people and said that any plan or development project with little participation of area people could not be fruitful.

He expressed the hope that CPEC and other development projects would bring about prosperity to the province.

The chief minister said that the provincial government was trying its best to ensure a congenial and investment-friendly atmosphere in the province.

He sought the help of the federal government, policy makers and potential investors in establishing more schools with top quality education, hospitals with modern facilities in the province and a water scheme ensuring clean-drinking water for the people of Gwadar.

The chief minister welcomed the CPEC project and termed it a gift of China for the people of the province.

Referring to different problems the province was facing, Mr Bizenjo said that the provincial government alone could not resolve them because of its limited resources. The problems, he said, included water shortage and economic backwardness, and sought financial and technical help of the federal government for the purpose.

He also demanded of the federal government to link Gwadar with the national grid for uninterrupted supply of electricity to the area and urged it to help the provincial government in laying of a water pipeline from Shadi Kaur Dam to Gwadar to ensure continuous drinking water supply to the people of Gwadar.

The chief minister expressed the hope that Gwadar Expo would bring about significant investment in the province.

THROUGHOUT history, military might and the politics of force have dominated global relations. But, with globalisation and the fourth Industrial Revolution, power components in both international and bilateral relations have shifted from the political-military expanse to economic (commercial) and cultural ones. That said, economic diplomacy the method through which states conduct their external commercial relations and leverage those connections based on economic prowess is not a new phenomenon. It has been used for centuries by savvy nations.

Since 1947, Pakistan has gone through periods of high economic growth and periods of almost non-viable economic growth. Such ebbs and flows have affected the overall economic growth of the country. With passing times, financial problems have increased manifold and, due to the lack of vision and reforms, the state is yet to find the path to economic sustainability.

Pakistan has always been enamoured of the notion of unforeseen threats. Such a mindset of threat perception has only come at the cost of economic ties and opportunities. Geopolitics has always been considered more relevant than geo-economics, even though the two intersect. As a result, economics or economic diplomacy has continued to be neglected in the face of security-related objectives.

Another kind of diplomacy is being neglected.

Today, the country scores inadequately on almost all economic indicators. Despite a change of fortunes in the last couple of years, both in economic growth and sustainable law and order, the country has far to progress on socio-economic pointers.

Therefore, it is bewildering why Pakistan's economic diplomacy is so ineffective, especially given how its neighbours have espoused and embraced it so diligently. Today, India is one of the fast-growing economies in the world, and it has used this economic might as diplomatic leverage with all its commercial partners. Worth a strong mention are its ties with both Israel and Iran. On the one hand, India continues to engage Israel without alienating the Arab world and its growing Muslim population. On the other hand, its ties with Iran continue to expand and deepen. This is a balancing act we can, and must, emulate.

Worth also mentioning here is Pakistan's economic ties with the US. For the last 70 years, despite all the financial aid and bilateral bonhomie, Pakistan has failed to foster a relationship based on mutual trade. Although the US is one of the leading export partners of Pakistan, it has been unable to exploit the economic opportunities presented by such ties, unlike China or India.

Today, China and India are both major investors in emerging US technologies. Name any big company and their CEO is almost certain to be of Indian descent; Google and Microsoft are just a couple in the long list. China, on the other hand, has invested massively in new start-ups. According to recent reports on CNBC and Bloomberg, China has been investing in fast-growth tech start-ups to broaden its interests and to take advantage of critical military technologies (military robotics, artificial intelligence, rocket engines, etc) offered by these new start-ups. The most famous example of China's expanding economic diplomacy is of course the One Belt One Road initiative.

More than ever before, Pakistan today is in need of economic diplomacy. With hostile neighbours and an unstable region, the primary aim of the government should be to swim through such instability with robust economic diplomacy. Pakistan has strategic importance, and trade and connectivity initiatives should be worked on with its neighbours, keeping in view the economic benefits.

Fortunately, CPEC is a brilliant example of such integration, which has the potential to not only uplift the social and economic landscape, but also to play a significant role in boosting Pakistan's exports. However, in commencing such an effort, it is vital that the government do everything in its power to protect local and indigenous industries affected by the massive influx of foreign goods.

While all these factors are important, unforeseen factors that play a critical role are political stability and the role of other socio-religious actors. The rise of the far right has further exacerbated Pakistan's sectarian divide and deepened its fissures. Such conditions are detrimental to economic growth and diplomacy.

Economic diplomacy can only be viable when the country is experiencing economic growth; a nation experiencing uncertainty and massive law and order issues can seldom become an economic power. Therefore, it is indeed time for policymakers in Islamabad to forge and implement a policy based on economic diplomacy that employs all its economic levers. If Pakistan can exercise its influence as a nuclear power with increased financial muscle, it could do far better as a nation than it has managed in the last 70 years.


 
 

 China , UNDP sign accord to help crisis-hit areas of Fata, Balochistan

In a unique example of South-South coll­aboration, China and the UNDP Pakistan signed a $4 million agreement on Friday to provide assistance over four months in crisis-affected areas of Fata and Balochistan.

At the signing ceremony, Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing said 'the successful launching of the project renews our commitment to deliver strong support to the people of Pakistan. The project will support the people in restoration of their livelihood and help rebuild their lives'.

In future, China would continue to increase the grant assistance to Pakistan, enriching categories and sectors, expanding the input into areas with pressing demands, including Fata and Balochistan, he said.

China is providing $1 billion to improve people's well-being and help the 'Belt and Road' countries meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Chinese ministry of commerce has signed a cooperation agreement with the UNDP under the 'Assistance Fund for South-South Cooperation', and in November last year China approved funding for Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal to meet immediate recovery needs of crisis-affected populations.

The Pakistan-China recovery initiative for Fata and Balochistan will contribute to meeting, among other goals, SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation).

Ignacio Artaza, the country director of UNDP Pakistan, said that Fata and Balochistan were among the country's least developed regions and, in recent years, had been severely affected by disasters. He said that Chinese support would help temporarily displaced families get back on their feet as they returned home after years of uncertainty, and help ensure that schools in Balochistan meet necessary conditions to keep young students in school.


 
 

Rethinking Afghanistan

REGARDLESS of the larger geopolitical context and possible regional and global realignments and trends, the sharp downturn in Pakistan-US relations remains essentially centred on our tangled Afghan policy. This offers hope that relations can be salvaged and reset to a constructive and workable engagement. From this perspective, we can look at US interests in Afghanistan, our own experience and lessons and what a way forward might be.

The US intends to stay militarily in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future. There is extensive discussion in Pakistan about US motives and goals. At times, these are explained in terms of US concerns about a rising China, and at times as part of plans to neutralise Pakistan's strategic assets if ever needed. To contain China, the US will rely on its options and ubiquitous presence in the Asia-Pacific rather than on a residual beleaguered force in Afghanistan.

Similarly, the hypothetical, albeit insane, contingency for kinetic action against Pakistani assets will depend on space and cyber technologies with faraway command and control than on paratroopers stationed next door. Another argument is that the US intends to stymie China's Belt and Road project, in particular CPEC. These projects are in progress despite the turmoil in Afghanistan and will receive a boost if Afghanistan settles down which is the ostensible US objective.

A simpler view is that great powers are averse to erasing their military footprint once established. Also, Washington cannot countenance a collapse or defeat in Kabul; its prestige is at stake. Failure to achieve the minimal objective of stabilising Afghanistan has frustrated US policymakers especially the defence establishment which had traditionally supported Pakistan.

What must follow is an honest and frank conversation with Washington and Kabul.

Arguably, all blame cannot be placed at the doorstep of Pakistan. It is impossible to explain the dysfunction of the Afghan army and the government in terms of alleged Taliban operations from 'safe havens' in Pakistan. There have been monumental initial US policy errors when the US lumped the Afghan Taliban together with Al Qaeda, disregarded the ethnic realities of Afghanistan and then shifted focus to Iraq. Yet, the US and Kabul accuse Pakistan of propping up the Afghan Taliban, and of deception and duplicity. Pakistan has its own catalogue of errors. Since the days of the Mujahideen infighting and the Taliban rule, Pakistan's policy was caught between Afghanistan's notorious ethnic fault lines. Non-Pakhtun factions did not trust Pakistan. The US intervention catapulted them into power in Kabul.

Notwithstanding public denials about 'safe havens', one justification of Pakistani backing of the Taliban rests on the premise that they are the only Afghan faction friendly to Pakistan. On the other hand, Kabul courts India with encouragement from Washington which is giving rise to a two-front situation, anathema to Pakistan, based on good evidence of collusion between the Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies. Apparently logical, this argument is self-contradictory. Perceived Pakistani support for the Taliban only pushes Kabul into the embrace of Delhi and lends credence to the Indian and Kabul narratives that Pakistan uses non-state actors as instrument of its policy. To counter Indian subversion from the Afghan soil, Pakistan will have to work with Kabul and Washington.

Today, Pakistan insists on recourse to political reconciliation which Kabul and Washington dismiss as a tactic to deflect pressure. Reconciliation has turned into a chimera riddled with contradictions. Of late, Washington and Kabul reject talking to the Taliban, whom they call 'terrorists', and look to a long haul to whittle down Taliban strength.

On the other hand, the Taliban want dialogue only with the US and that too for the withdrawal of Nato forces. Outside parties such as China and Russia can hardly infuse life into the process. Pakistan can commit little beyond exerting efforts to persuade the Taliban in case there is a meaningful offer on the table. Washington and Kabul demand that Pakistan hand over Taliban leaders if it cannot deliver them to reconciliation on Kabul's terms. The recent Taliban-claimed carnage in Kabul has only hardened this position. Meanwhile, the US has blocked all military assistance to Pakistan, including the amounts due under the Coalition Support Fund (CSF), and threatens sanctions.

CSF was an unsavoury arrangement and the source of escalating American demands to 'do more'. Its demise should cause no lament. Still, Pakistan should look for normalcy in relations with the United States based on a better understanding of each other's concerns rather than on aid. Pakistan's equanimity in response to the rude New Year tweet and aid cut-off, and its decision to keep open the air and ground logistics are sound policy. What must follow is an honest and frank conversation with Washington and Kabul.

For that, we need clarity in our position. If the Taliban leadership has shifted inside Afghanistan, we must credibly prove our contention. Otherwise we need to revisit the issue and ensure that operations inside Afghanistan do not originate from our territory. We cannot hand these leaders to Kabul for obvious cultural reasons and concerns over a religious right-wing backlash. But we must do all we can to prevent abuse of our territory, consistent with our position not to allow the Afghan war to be fought on our soil.

We must at the same time ask for an end to Afghan-based subversion against Pakistan. Our engagement with Washington and Kabul should bring clarity to each other's red lines. Besides reconciliation, other issues include management of the border, the fence, Afghan transit trade facilities and fair compensation for logistics support to Nato and countering the emerging militant Islamic State group. This is time for active diplomacy. Our friends can help. But success will rest on the clarity of our position.

Pakistan's four decades of involvement with the Afghan conflict has been enormously costly. We missed out on opportunities offered by globalisation, ascendance of geo-economics and the opening up of Central Asia. Our aspirations for becoming a hub of economic activities for surrounding regions remained just a dream. Instead, we have been sucked into the vortex of extremist and religious violence and obscurantism ravaging the region especially the greater Middle East. Now we have pinned hopes on CPEC, but for realising the potential of that great enterprise, we need to rethink Afghanistan.


 
 

 China  in talks with Baloch militants to secure CPEC projects, says FT

China has been quietly holding talks with Baloch militants for more than five years in an effort to protect the $60 billion worth of infrastructure projects it is financing as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Financial Times claimed on Monday.

Three people with knowledge of the talks told the paper that Beijing had been in direct contact with militants in Balochistan, where many of the CPEC-related schemes are located.

'The Chinese have quietly made a lot of progress,' one Pakistani official told Financial Times. 'Even though separatists occasionally try to carry out the odd attack, they are not making a forceful push.'

For more than half a century, Beijing has maintained a policy of non-interference in the domestic politics of other countries. But that has been tested by its desire to protect the billions of dollars it is investing around the world under its Belt and Road Initiative to create a 'new Silk Road' of trade routes in Europe, Asia and Africa.

Pakistani officials welcome negotiations between Beijing and insurgents

As it seeks to boost the Chinese economy, China's plans for the new Silk Road has pitched it into some of the world's most complex conflict zones.

Chinese peacekeepers are already in South Sudan, where Beijing has invested in oilfields and is planning to build a rail line. China has also contributed troops to a UN peacekeeping operation in Mali and even talked about launching attacks against the militant Islamic State group in Iraq, where it has been the largest foreign investor in the country's oil sector.

In Pakistan, Beijing appears keen to fill the void left by Washington, which has drifted from its former ally after becoming frustrated at Islamabad's failure to tackle extremism.

Some have warned that China's investment could lead to Pakistan being treated like a client state by Beijing, despite promises that Chinese troops would not be stationed there.

The paper claimed that the Pakistani officials welcomed the talks between Baloch rebels and Chinese envoys, even if they do not know the details of what has been discussed.

'Ultimately, if there's peace in Balochistan, that will benefit both of us,' said one official in Islamabad.

Another said that the recent decision by the US to suspend security assistance to Pakistan had convinced many in Islamabad that China was a more genuine partner.

'[The Chinese] are here to stay and help Pakistan, unlike the Americans, who cannot be trusted,' the official said.

Chinese officials did not comment on the talks, though the Chinese ambassador to Islamabad said in a recent interview with the BBC that militants in Balochistan were no longer a threat to the economic corridor.

One provincial tribal leader said many young men had been persuaded to lay down their weapons by the promise of financial benefits.

'Today, young men are not getting attracted to join the insurgents as they did some 10 years ago,' he said. 'Many people see prosperity' as a result of the CPEC, he added.

Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani said on Monday that the Pakistan-China relationship was a bulwark against western designs in the region.

Speaking as the chief guest at the launch of a report, 'CPEC: Facts versus Fiction', he said the western designs in the region included destabilisation through regime change. The United States, he added, was currently trying to impose India as a regional policeman.

The programme was organised by the Pakistan-China Institute, a think-tank devoted to promoting people-to-people relations between Pakistan and China, in collaboration with JS Group. The report has been prepared with an aim to clear misconception about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

At the programme the institute's project of establishing Chinese language classes in various cities of Pakistan was also inaugurated.

Report 'CPEC: Facts versus Fiction' launched

The Senate chairman said that the Pakistan-China friendship was the demonstration of the 'Asian Dream'. This friendship should not be seen as a cultural takeover of China, he said, adding: 'We made this mistake with the West by totally submitting ourselves to it in the past.'

He said initiatives like the CPEC and 'One Belt One Road' have added further impetus to bilateral relations between Pakistan and China.

Mr Rabbani lambasted western countries for their imperialist past, colonialism and their current political philosophies that included designs to politically destabilise various countries of the world.

'The India-Israel-US nexus would jeopardise regional peace and developments make it abundantly clear that the US is trying to make New Delhi a new policeman of this region as the West has finally realised that the people of Asia would shape the destiny of their region and would take a lead in making the Asian dream come true by controlling its own resources,' he said.

Mr Rabbani called for the country's provinces to work for promotion of local languages. He said respecting cultures of each other would lead to an environment of national harmony. He regretted that the military dictators in the country discouraged regional cultures on the assumption that they would weaken the federation.

Ambassador of China MrYao Jing said that the Pakistan-China relations were achieving new heights and that the CPEC was the manifestation of the bond between the two countries.

He said China had always stood by Pakistan just as Pakistan stood by China. This is 'all weather' friendship between the two 'iron brothers', he added.

The founder of Pakistan-China Institute, Senator Mushahid Hussain Saiyed, said that there had been deliberate attempts to create misconceptions about the CPEC in which India and its western patrons played a prominent part. The reason behind creating such misconceptions was geo-political because there was an attempt to build up India as a counterweight to China with baseless propaganda about the 'China threat'.

In reply to a question about the CPEC, he said when the economic corridor project was launched in 2013, Pakistan was perceived to be isolated, terror-stricken and a 'failing' state.

Where autumn follows spring, Nothing comes to fruition

THE FATF embarrassment, utterly isolating and shameful as it is, has become the norm for Pakistan. Along with so much else that has isolated and humiliated us this too was so obviously coming and was so stupidly and irresponsibly ignored. The debt riddled 'development' taking place in Pakistan has been made even more fragile.

Critical commentators are often accused of being unnecessarily bitter about the state of the country. But when the state of governance is so criminal and damaging how else can one accurately depict the truth about our rulers who day in and day out unhesitatingly make a mockery and laughing stock of the country?

Putting on a polite mask while gently admonishing the perpetrators of such betrayal is itself a form of betrayal given the wretched depths to which our incorrigible rulers regularly sink.

China has gone out of its way to protect Pakistan from international criticism, humiliation, isolation and punishment despite its own grave concerns about the latitude extremists and terrorists enjoy in Pakistan, some of whom directly and indirectly pose a threat to stability in its western region. In this case China once again stood by Pakistan.

But, as a result of an egregiously misleading and triumphant tweet which was apparently against the procedures of FATF, our inept foreign minister ensured the reversal of a face-saving reprieve for Pakistan. We forfeited, at least for the moment, the confidence of two of our staunchest friends, Saudi Arabia and, most important, China itself.

Only Pakistan can isolate itself and it has done so repeatedly.

But the rot lies deeper. India has not isolated Pakistan. The US has not isolated Pakistan. Afghanistan has not isolated Pakistan. They cannot. Only Pakistan can isolate itself and it has done so repeatedly looking towards China to bail it out every time.

Don't we have any consideration for the interests of China which is besieged by US and Indian policies to contain its emergence as a force for Eurasian peace, stability and development and which, moreover, has made Pakistan a cornerstone of its historic initiative in Central and South Asia?

Is there no respect for the national interest of Pakistan which is so eagerly and regularly sacrificed at the altar of institutional, class and private interests? Are our people really fodder for the vicious appetites of insatiable domestic predators?

Can a weary acceptance of such reality as inevitable be compatible with the merest loyalty to our people and country? Is there anything that needs to be said that has not been said ad nauseam without any effect?

How shamefully many of us reviled our feisty lioness for human rights, development, security and freedom, Asma Jahangir! And those of us who admired and revered her never quite lent her sufficient support for her lifelong struggle. Are we even capable of honouring her memory?

We have a mantra. Pakistan is the biggest victim of terrorism. Pakistan has sacrificed more than any country in the war against terror. Pakistan has lost thousands of precious civilian and military lives and financially lost over a hundred billion dollars in this war which is not even our war! Millions of people in Fata have been displaced. Pakistan has taken out several terrorist organisations especially the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, the militant Islamic State group and Al Qaeda.

Pakistan has banned several domestic extremist organisations, detained their leaders and frozen their accounts. Pakistan cannot become the battleground for an Afghan civil war. Pakistan has an independent judiciary and cannot take actions in violation of its rulings. Pakistan is not receiving the cooperation it needs for border management and control. Neither the US nor the Afghans pick up the extremists whom Pakistan forces back into Afghanistan.

On the contrary, they are sheltered and encouraged to launch attacks on targets inside Pakistan with India's assistance from Afghan territory. There are no safe havens, sanctuaries or shuras in Pakistan. There are still millions of Afghan refugees who pose serious security and terrorist risks for Pakistan which is being made the scapegoat for American failure in Afghanistan. Moreover an attack on Pakistan is an attack on CPEC and the Belt and Road Initiative which are opposed by the US and India. Etc.

Much of the above is true. But it is not the whole truth. It is a half-truth which in many ways is worse than a lie. It hides at least as much as it reveals. The US and India cannot by themselves convince the world to gratuitously isolate Pakistan. Doing some good does not entitle one to do wrong.

This is especially so when the 'good' is seen to have been extracted like a tooth by the surgical threat of sanctions and the use of force, while the 'wrong' is seen to stem from perverted mindsets and entrenched policies.

The bitter truth is that Pakistan's vigorous denials are seen by most countries as blatant lies, and part of a pattern going back decades which reflects a sustained emasculation of the democratic process. While India and the US are often criticised for their domestic and international conduct, and Afghanistan is seen as a failed state, none of this translates into much international sympathy and understanding for Pakistan's protestations about its role in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

Why? This is a question that from time to time is discussed in the public realm. But its systematic discussion is not welcomed within the corridors of power. This reflects an aversion to facing plain truths and, accordingly, a general preference to concentrate on details and responses rather than fundamental issues and strategic realities. These, of course, require longer-term perspectives to develop policy consistency and credibility.

The very considerable abilities, expertise and passionate commitment of the Foreign Office are simply not availed of by arrogant and incompetent 'superiors' whose commitments are devoted more to blowing their own trumpets than to serving their nation. This is the real betrayal that informs every aspect of our national policy.

All our questions and problems have practical solutions provided the right intentions prevail.


 
 

Planning and patience

THE Financial Action Task Force debacle is the latest illustration of the consequences of obligations (the 1267 listing of the Lashkar-e-Taiba [LeT]) hastily accepted under external pressure, which are difficult to implement.

Once threatened with being put back on FATF's grey list Islamabad acted in panic. Pakistan's diplomats succeeded, in closed meetings, to avert the listing. But this was reversed in a strong American reaction to Pakistan's premature tweet of triumph. Now, Pakistan faces more extensive demands and the prospect of being put on the FATF's black list. Hopefully, we will not combine incompetence with ingratitude by blaming our friends for the debacle.

The public reversal in Paris was executed by the US as part of its campaign to coerce Pakistan to act against the Afghan Taliban and pro-Kashmiri groups and accept unilateral restraints on Pakistan's nuclear and missile programmes.

Without a clear plan, Pakistan can fall into the trap of making piecemeal concessions.

It is unclear if Pakistan has formulated a strategy to respond to the US (and Indian) campaign of pressure. Islamabad's public statements have ranged from anger at American insults and defiance of its demands to appeals for Washington's understanding and indication of support to the new US strategy in the region.

Pakistan's ability to negotiate an acceptable outcome with the US will depend on: one, clearly identifying its objectives, priorities and red lines; two, convincing Washington that it will reject US demands if these cross Pakistan's red lines ; and, three, generating support for its positions from China, Russia, Turkey, Iran and other regional powers.

Without a clear strategy and plan, Pakistan is likely to fall into the trap of making piecemeal concessions that add up to capitulation. Unfortunately, this seems to be the present trajectory. US officials have boasted that they have Pakistan's attention and that they see some positive steps although not yet a strategic policy shift.

All diplomacy is transactional. If Pakistan gives something, it must get something in return. Asking for respect from the US is not enough. Such respect will depend on the resilience which Pakistan displays in the defence and promotion of its core national interests.

On Afghanistan, Pakistan appears to have persuaded the Afghan Taliban to offer talks to the US. The US has countered by asking the Taliban to talk to the Kabul government (which the Taliban consider an American puppet). President Ghani has offered to talk with the Taliban and to recognise them as a legitimate negotiating party. This offer is unlikely to get the Taliban on board.

Pakistan, together with other regional states, needs to build on these developments to revive the peace talks, perhaps in the Quadrilateral (Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, the US) Coordination Mechanism or another format. But as Pakistan propels the talks, it cannot be asked simultaneously to kill or capture Taliban leaders. The US should also take reciprocal action to eliminate the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan's safe havens in Afghanistan and terminate Indian-sponsored terrorism in Balochistan and Fata from Afghan territory.

With regard to the pro-Kashmiri groups, Pakis­tan, having accepted the UNSC listing of the LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammad, is obliged to fulfil its obligations under UNSC Resolution 1267. It will need to find other legitimate ways to support India-held Kashmir's freedom struggle.

In response to the US pressure, Pakistan can express its willingness to help in reducing militant violence in IHC if India's security forces end their massive human rights violations there. Pakistan should also expect the US to arrest India's current belligerence and threats, including the daily ceasefire violations along the Line of Control. This can lead to a disastrous war that could escalate to the nuclear level.

While working for an agreement on US non-proliferation objectives, Pakistan will have to resist demands for unilateral restraint on Pakistan's nuclear and missile programmes. As an alternative, Pakistan should propose a set of measures for reciprocal arms control and disarmament between Pakistan and India and invite the US to help in securing India's agreement to such mutual restraint.

However, Pakistan should be in no hurry to conclude agreements with the US if they are inconsistent with Pakistan's vital interests. Pakistan can afford to exercise strategic patience for several reasons.

One, as US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis has stated, henceforth, the US security priority will be competition with China and Russia, rather than terrorism. Also, the Trump administration's multidirectional belligerence is likely to lead to new confrontations (with North Korea, Iran, Russia and China). Afghanistan may become a sideshow. A consensus may emerge in Washington that Afghanistan is a strategic liability and should be abandoned.

Two, Washington's domestic dynamics may propel a change in US policy on Afghanistan and South Asia and other issues. Trump could be impeached. The Democrats may gain control of the Congress in the upcoming midterm elections. Trump may decide to cooperate with rather than confront China (and downgrade the alliance with India). In most of these scenarios, American and Indian hostility towards Pakistan is likely to diminish.

Three, over the longer term, America's ability to exert military and economic pressure on Pakistan and other states will diminish. America is politically and socially divided. Its internal wounds will take time to heal after the Trump era. China, on the other hand, will enjoy policy consistency under Xi Jinping's extended leadership. It also has economic momentum, growing at seven per cent annually. By 2040, China will account for over 20pc of global GDP; the US for 13pc; India for 7pc.

When economically integrated with the 65 countries covered by the Belt and Road Initiative, China's influence and impact on the global economy, and thus on global politics, will significantly surpass that of the US, whose main instrument of influence is an expensive military. For most of the world's nations, the choice between an open and affluent China and a closed, mean and militarist America will be a no-brainer.

Pakistan, with China as a strategic partner, can expect to be on the right side of history. Despite its present weaknesses, Islamabad need not concede to the US or India on any of its core national security objectives: independence from Indian hegemony; credible nuclear and conventional deterrence; a fair solution for Jammu and Kashmir; a friendly Afghanistan.


 
 

Balancing ties

RECENTLY, the National Security Committee claimed that a so-called recalibration in foreign policy is under way.

The emphasis henceforth will be on ratcheting up ties with countries of the region and pursuing economic initiatives.

Now, two senior ministers of the PML-N government have in comments to Reuters suggested that a number of energy-related projects with Russia may cause a breakthrough in bilateral ties that were strained for much of the Cold War and plummeted after the then USSR invaded Afghanistan in 1979.

Alongside a deepening of economic ties with China, CPEC being a significant component of the Belt and Road Initiative, Pakistan could finally realise the potential for regional trade and connectivity that this country's geographic position has given it.

Therefore, pursuing a deepening of economic and diplomatic ties on a mutually beneficial basis with Russia and creating opportunities for the Pakistani public to travel to and work in regional economies ought to be a central goal of the state and elected governments.

Certainly, there will be a number of challenges.

The ambitious CPEC partnership has deepened doubts about the willingness of the Pakistani state to be transparent and its ability to negotiate the best possible economic terms in every deal.

Beyond negotiating strategy and economic vision, however, there is potentially a greater problem: viewing ties with China and Russia through the prism of deteriorating relations with the US.

A rising China and a more aggressive Russia have shaped a global narrative of greater competition and the increasing likelihood of conflict with the US.

But in Pakistani strategic circles, a deterioration in ties with the US, primarily because of the war in Afghanistan, and a perception that India and the US are combining to put pressure on Pakistan are offered as compelling reasons why this country must turn away from America and towards China and Russia.

That is the wrong approach.

Instead, as Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif has said, Pakistan is not seeking a 'divorce' from the West, 'but a balance in [Pakistan's] relationships'.

Indeed, a great benefit of Pakistan's geostrategic position ought to be friendly ties with all big powers, not tilting from one side to the next.

The visit of Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua to the US, then, ought not to be merely about fire-fighting, but part of a wide-ranging and high-level process of stabilising and improving ties with the US.

While there are legitimate grievances on both sides of the Pakistan-US relationship, it ought to be clear that disengagement or a further ratcheting down of ties would be mutually damaging.

Regional engagement should not mean global disengagement.

Perhaps the national security apparatus should also make it clear that regional engagement means all countries of the region.

Afghanistan and India should be encouraged to join regional trade and connectivity projects that Pakistan may pursue.


 
 

Pakistan and the web of international economic corridors

IRAN has leased India a part of Chabahar port for 18 months. Both countries also plan to build a rail link from Chabahar to Zahedan, which is just 100 kilometres from Taftan, the Pakistani border town. Pakistan already has a rail link with Zahedan via Taftan but the track is in poor condition.

India was interested in the development of Chabahar port way back in 2003. However, the development work slowed down considerably with the onset of American sanctions.

There has recently been a flurry of effort to develop economic corridors, especially in Europe and Asia. On forefront is China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), of which the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is of great significance for Pakistan.

The BRI aims to create a web of infrastructure on land and sea, connecting the East to the West. Under the plan, China will develop six wide-ranging economic corridors. Of them, four aim to connect China to Europe through Central Asia via road and rail. Two are maritime corridors across Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Africa.

There has recently been a flurry of effort to develop economic corridors, especially in Europe and Asia

BRI's basic objectives are facilitating cross-continent trade, geo-economic integration and ensuring the availability of multiple supply routes for Chinese shipments.

Initially apprehensive of China's concept of the Silk Road Economic Belt, Russia ultimately joined BRI after the Ukraine crisis erupted. On the other hand, India didn't join BRI from day one, with major concerns over CPEC.

CPEC constitutes an important component of the BRI. Over the years, Pakistan had faced downward trends in foreign direct investment, owing primarily to difficult security environment in the region. Viewed as such, the upcoming $62 billion investments in energy, infrastructure, communication and port development are expected to add much value to Pakistan's GDP.

Resultantly, India is in search of alternatives. Acquiring a part of Chabahar port is one such move. In partnership with Iran and Russia, India wants to operationalise 7,200km International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which is a multi-mode sea, road and rail network among India, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Central Asia and Europe.

Iranian daily Financial Tribune reported that India plans to move goods from Indian ports to Iran's Bandar Abbas by sea (bypassing Pakistan) and then to Russia and Europe. The corridor may become operational in a few weeks.

Further, India has plans to use TIR carnets for transiting cargo through the INSTC, as it apprehends that Pakistan will not allow it to use them at its Wagah land route. China may also use the carnets soon for transit across member countries, including Pakistan.

India is also reactivating a 1,360km road project linking north-eastern India with Thailand and beyond. A Bloomberg report suggests New Delhi may extend the Myanmar-Thailand link with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.

Similarly, according to The Australian Financial Review, the United States, Japan, India and Australia are contemplating an alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative.

As for Chabahar, India intends to use the port for transit of cargo to Afghanistan bypassing Pakistan, as the country does not allow transit facility to India through the Wagah land route, though this facility is available through the sea route.

Under the AfghanistanPakistan Transit Trade Agreement, Pakistan provides transit facility to Afghanistan via sea ports as well as one-way traffic to India through Wagah. The flow has been steadily increasing in recent years.

When Chabahar port becomes operational, it will have a distance almost equal to the Karachi-Gwadar-Chaman route to Afghanistan.

However, the development of the Chabahar route will not reduce the significance of the Karachi-Torkham-Kabul route as it caters to a different area inside Afghanistan. On Chabahar-Gwadar routes, distances are almost equal and much will depend upon available port facilities, customs procedures, costs and time involved and corridor security. Earlier completion of rail link with Afghanistan will be an added advantage.

Pakistan is also a signatory of the ECO Transit Trade Agreement and a Quadrilateral Transit Agreement. After the start of transit operations under TIR, intraregional trade within ECO countries may pick up. Tajikistan is also interested in gaining transit access through Pakistan. Upon the activation of the CPEC transit corridor, Tajikistan can be encouraged to use it through China, as Afghanistan is hesitant to allow the use of its territory unless Pakistan allows India to use its land route.

Additionally, infrastructure development on the route and at border crossing is of utmost significance to enhance regional trade connectivity. Under Integrated Transit Trade Management System, Pakistan plans to modernise border crossing terminals at Torkham, Chaman and Wagah. Similar steps are needed at Taftan. Pakistan should also consider linking Gwadar and Quetta through rail and upgrade the Quetta-Taftan track.

Information exchange is another area where Pakistan needs to electronically link all bordering countries. The use of juxtaposed customs offices at borders can further facilitate trade and save costs and time.


 
 

NON-FICTION: LIVING ON THE BORDER

Having driven regularly since 2012 from Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, to Syafru Bensi, a Nepalese town bordering China, the changes I've seen take place along the way are striking. Initially, traffic was limited to a few trucks and mostly private cars along a bumpy road that was often blocked by landslides. The large trailers coming from Delhi or Calcutta all the way into the valleys beyond Kathmandu were much more numerous along the route. A hydropower plant deep in the gorge, allegedly solely built by Chinese engineers, was slowly progressing from year to year. When an earthquake hit, construction on the plant came to an abrupt halt, but lorry traffic from China suddenly flourished. Because another major route had been blocked, this rugged road suddenly had to bear the weight of heavy traffic, and we wound up sharing our campsite with truck drivers waiting for the border to open so they could pick up apples grown on the Tibetan Plateau and take them to market in Kathmandu.

Another change was how quickly shops in the border town mushroomed, offering t-shirts with misspelled Italian brand names and 'Adibas' shoes with four stripes. While international NGOs in Kathmandu were busy advocating for more efficient ovens in the mud-built houses off the main road for reasons of health and also sustainable wood consumption, the solution very suddenly came from the other side: locals bought the ovens at cheap rates on the Tibetan side of the border and had them delivered to their doorstep.

Looking through the larger, geopolitical lens, these changes are a result of the Chinese One Belt One Road initiative, the country's strategy to enhance its connectivity within Eurasia. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in Pakistan is one building block, but many more exist in all directions. China has been actively trying to manage its vast borderlands for many decades and, while attention often lies on the announcement of grandiose plans of investment, few stories exist of those actually living at these borders. As Tina Harris, one of the contributors to The Art of Neighbouring: Making Relations Across China's Borders, edited by Martin Saxer and Juan Zhang, puts in the chapter 'The Mobile and the Material in the Himalayan Borderlands', '... the border is seen as governed by top-down laws and policies that are intangible to the inhabitants who live in these lands. Yet it makes more sense to think of how people deal with their borders instead of the other way around.'

Seeing China's vast borderlands through the eyes of those who must deal with the challenge of living with neighbours on friendly terms

This book provides such an attempt. Although not comprehensive in the geographic scope and especially disappointing for readers with a keen interest in the Chinese borderlands along the Karakoram Highway lacking accounts from Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the book combines, in an easily accessible manner, a number of different approaches to describing what (commercial) life along the frictious borderlands can look like.

An overarching theme is the challenge of living with a neighbour on friendly terms, but with suspicion always lurking underneath. 'Amidst the most amicable efforts to be good neighbours, suspicion lures, waiting to be confirmed,' writes Zhang in 'Neighbouring Anxiety Along the China-Vietnam Border'. What if those traders, speaking another language, suddenly decide not to show up the next year and buy the produce waiting for them? What if they don't return to pay debts? What if their provincial government suddenly decides to ban any trade over the border post, or no investments are made to reconstruct an essential road devastated by landslides?

This suspicion is, however, counteracted by the allure of the exciting 'Other' that possibly offers opportunities not found on this side of the border. In 'Bright Lights Across the River: Competing Modernities at China's Edge', Frank Billé describes an old Russian border town Blagoveshchensk that has a Chinese twin on the other side of the Amur river, mimicking it in many ways, only doing so with much more ample resources. The Russians feel humiliated, but at the same time more and more cross the border for the economic opportunities on offer on the other side.

In the chapter 'Odd Neighbours: Trans-Himalayan Tibetan Itineraries and Chinese Economic Development', Chris Vasantkumar, with accounts from Tibetans who crossed into India but eventually returned to China, argues that casting all Tibetans who have sought this path in the first place as refugees is not very helpful. Motivations are more complex and the opportunity of an English education on the Indian side, which in turn translates to economic opportunity on the Chinese side, intertwines with religious, cultural and political drivers. This way, those familiar enough with the border and the people on the other side become agents of exchange or, as Renaud Egreteau puts it in a description of Burmese Muslims on the Myanmar-China border 'middlemen minorities' between the two countries.

While I expected the Tibetans I work with on the Nepalese side of the border to harbour ire against China for reasons of religious and cultural conflict, they see their neighbour largely through the prism of their daily livelihoods. The opportunities to import cheap handicrafts to be sold to Western trekkers in Nepal, and the chance to acquire household goods that improve their living standards as envisioned in long documents of development agencies in the Western world, but without the bureaucratic hurdles trump any suspicion on grounds of religious persecution.

If they can read the tide that is, developments in often far away provincial and national governments and remain flexible in their business endeavours, these middlemen can become prosperous merchants in these often remote areas. Pakistan-China relations are currently often seen through the CPEC prism, economic development in Punjab and pompous meetings in Islamabad and Beijing, but it is the people from Gilgit, Gulmit and Sost, or Pakistani students doing their PhD in western China, who have been and are in touch with their Chinese counterparts all along. They are likely able to tell a story of more immediate effect of the ups and downs of this long-standing exchange. And exposed to this neighbouring in their everyday life and versed in the languages of exchange, they are likely the better experts to judge how this friendship will look like many years down the road.


 
 

New South Asia geography

THE contours of a new economic and political geography within South Asia are clearly emerging on the map with enhanced connectivity among China, Pakistan, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia.

This transition is already having a remarkable influence on the thinking patterns, politics, cultures and economic developments in this region.

While the traditional South Asian political elite remains in a perpetual denial captured by populist internal dynamics, the subcontinent has already disintegrated once again.

For the two South Asian nuclear powers, it is perhaps the right time to get out of their historical baggage and start working on dealing with the new realities and models of engagement with multiple players in the next many years to come. There are fundamental foreign, economic, security and overall public policy shifts which are bound to emerge as a result of the new regional alliances.

Also read: Talking about the economy

For the first time, this new geography is primarily driven by the dynamics of economic proximity rather than a security-led paradigm which dominated the region for many decades.

China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the strategic China Pakistan Economic Corridor have laid solid foundations.

The success of CPEC as a transformational investment is critical for both China and Pakistan to demonstrate their ability to steer this region towards a shared prosperity.

For Pakistan, three areas of structural reforms need urgent attention for managing an extraordinary transition.

Pakistan is struggling to design and implement structural reforms to increase its institutional capacity for maximising the CPEC outcomes for the benefit of its over 100 million young labour force. CPEC should not be seen as merely an infrastructure investment, it must reflect President Xi's vision of tackling corruption, cleaner environment and uplifting the quality of life for the marginalised.

For Pakistan, three areas of structural reforms need urgent attention for managing this extraordinary transition.

Firstly, Pakistan will have to strengthen the structure and orientation of its foreign service and economic ministries. The existing system has little understanding of the already changed and continuously evolving global economic landscape.

Several countries have taken progressive steps by merging trade and foreign policy objectives. Pakistan needs to act on the same lines and develop a consensus on medium-term strategic economic growth goals to be owned and delivered by the highest office.

The diplomats must be equipped with adequate skills to articulate the country's economic value proposition to the region and the rest of the world.

Secondly, there is a need to mainstream the role of private sector in the new economic growth strategy where proximity will have a central role.

The country should be willing to let go the sectors which have flourished on patronage and state protection. Pakistan's competiveness has nose-dived over the past couple of decades when compared with its peers.

The old school of import substitution by protecting local industrial base has led to the creation of a classic model of crony capitalism where such firms will never be able to compete with emerging Asia.

If a level-playing policy environment is created, the private sector can enhance productivity and ensure job creation by being part of the global value chains.

Thirdly, investment in regional knowledge networks will be crucial to sustain Pakistan's key position in the new regional markets.

Pakistan must benefit from China's phenomenal research and development expertise in all spheres and link up its universities and think tanks with south and west Asian neigbours.

It is the exchange of skilled youth which will generate ideas and strengthen the regional integration for shared growth and stability.

Unfortunately, India and Pakistan have missed the boat on leveraging their phenomenal economic potential of ideal proximity and a combined market of over one billion people.

According to some informed modelling and estimates, the two markets could have reached $20 billion volume of trade and investment.

Both countries have themselves to blame as the pace of change does not wait for players who fail to demonstrate their ability to resolve conflicts and continue to defy adherence to values of a responsible neighbourhood.

Having consistently failed to engage constructively, both countries will have to settle with two separate economic groupings in the emerging Asian century.

While India has already started investing in Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, Pakistan will now be looking to integrate more with the markets of Iran, western China and Central Asia through Afghanistan in the coming years.

This new economic geography will not only test overall foreign relations but will perhaps also set parameters for a new model of responsible engagement between India and Pakistan in the long term.

The fundamental point in question for Pakistan is its ability to come up with an institutional response to these rather challenging developments which will put pressure on Pakistan to open up borders with Afghanistan and Iran in the coming years. The security lens will have to be widened to economic, cyber and intercultural spheres.

Perhaps the weakest link is the economic policy structure which is marred with lack of capacity, coordination, leadership, exposure and imagination. A cosy and non-inclusive relationship between the finance ministry and international financial institutions has only resulted in unproductive debt burden and lucrative jobs for retired bureaucrats.

The global financial institutions are becoming irrelevant in terms of providing quality advice in a rapidly changing geopolitical environment. Long-term multilateral loans should be utilised for financially viable projects rather than the so-called policy-based budget support.

Pakistan needs to quickly initiate a progressive model of economic reforms in line with the changing regional and global dynamics. This will not only ensure sustainability of economic growth but will also put Pakistan in a leadership position in the new South Asian economic geography.

The political fragmentation and flux is the new normal and leadership must find ways to insulate key economic reforms from political volatility and elite capture.

It is the economic repositioning of Pakistan in the new Asian century which will attract capital and innovation from around the world.

Influen­tial Iranian scholar and former foreign minister Dr Kamal Kharazi on Tuesday backed a Pakistani proposal for quadrilateral cooperation between Pakistan, Iran, China and Russia.

Speaking at a conference at the Islamabad Policy Institute (IPI) on 'Pakistan and Security in West Asia', Dr Kharazi, who is currently leading Tehran-based Strategic Council on Foreign Relations a think tank believed to be close to Iran's power structures said: 'The proposal put forward by Pakistan on cooperation between Pakistan, Iran, China and Russia in security and economic realm should be studied.'

He said existing geo-political environment in the West and South Asia and the US policies, which were against both countries, made it imperative for them to cooperate.

He listed a number of steps that Tehran and Islamabad could take for increasing their cooperation, which included security and intelligence collaboration, working together for peace and stability in Afghanistan, developing connectivity between Gwadar and Chahbahar ports, completing the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project, boosting trade and economic relations, having currency swap arrangement, and enhancing people-to-people contact.

About Pakistani concerns vis-à-vis India in Iran, he said Tehran was not oblivious to the reservations. He said the best way to address those concerns was for Pakistan to join the Chahbahar project along with China and connect it with Gwadar. This, he said, would remove Pakistan's concerns and also further objectives of Chinese 'One Belt One Road' initiative.

He urged Pakistan to address Iran's security concerns, especially on its eastern border.

Dr Kharazi said Pakistan, despite being part of anti-Iran alliance led by Saudi Arabia, had remained impar­tial. He urged Islamabad to play the role of a 'constructive intermediary' for resolving the disputes am­ong the Muslim countries.

Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani stressed the need for a multilateral approach, involving Pakis­tan and Iran, for regional peace and security. He, however, underscored that Islamabad and Tehran would have to be mindful of each other's concerns.

Dr Kharazi, during a meeting with National Security Advi­ser retired Lt Gen Nasser Janjua, said Pakistan and Iran were facing common challenges due to prolonged instability in Afghanistan.

Gen Janjua and Dr Kharazi welcomed Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's offer of dialogue to the Taliban and asked the warring groups to make use of it to seek an enduring peace for Afghanistan. 'We all need to work together for the stability of Afghanistan,' they further agreed.

'Neglect of smaller provinces can make CPEC boon a bane'

Panelists at an international conference were unanimous that Pakistan's larger provinces Punjab and Sindh appear to be given priority in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), creating an impression of neglecting the smaller provinces in this pilot project of the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative.

The current structuring of the constitution, it seems, prevents the smaller provinces from challenging, directly or indirectly, the federal authority over the planning or implementation of the CPEC, was the nutshell of views expressed on Day 1 of the conference titled 'The Great Transformation: the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and Culture, Economy and Society in Pakistan' on Friday. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) and the University of Nottingham (UK) organised the event.

'Priority is being given to Sindh and Punjab which are already more developed. There are long-standing grievances regarding the neglect of the other provinces,' said Prof Katherine Adeney (Director of the Institute of Asia and Pacific Studies, The University of Nottingham) while giving a presentation on 'The Impact of CPEC on Pakistan's Federalism'.

The session was moderated by Dr Asma Faiz and experts from the UK, Canada and Pakistan presented their papers covering various aspects of the project.

Dr Adeney said the data mentioned that the Council of Common Interests (CCI) had very limited discussions on the project. 'In the CCI, a key to the 18th Amendment, extremely limited discussion was held about the CPEC initially as it was raised in only two of the eight meetings since April 2015,' she added.

While giving his input on the issue of 'Provincial Inability to Confront Federal Authority over the CPEC in the Court System', Prof Sikandar Ahmed Shah (LUMS) said the Supreme Court of Pakistan enjoys no executory authority in disputes between the provinces, or between the provinces and the federal government.

'Under Article 184 (2), the SC can only exercise declaratory jurisdiction when adjudicating these kinds of disputes, but lacks the authority to implement its judgments or entertain cases where the non-implementation of its orders thereof are alleged,' he said.

'Historically, this SC's inability to effect or implement its judgments has, at times, led provinces to cloak their legal challenges against the federal government by indirectly facilitating individual citizens to file lawsuits against the federal government under Article 184 (3) for violations of constitutional fundamental rights of public importance a clause under which the Supreme Court does possess executory jurisdiction,' he elaborated.

As for the CPEC passage through the disputed territory, he said he didn't see this as an issue under the international laws. 'India constructed dams like Kishan Ganga and Pakistan too did it by constructing Neelum-Jhelum. And the international donors / funding agencies too provided funds for this project,' he added.

Marium Mufti from Canada said opposition to and favour of the project by the analysts was being done on the basis of speculations and untested assumptions about the likely perceptions held by Pakistan's elite.

Among other speakers was Saeed Shafqat from the Centre for Public Policy and Governance. He was of the view that Pakistan would be able to benefit from the CPEC if policies surrounding this project are transparent.

Saba Shahid, also from CPPG, corroborated this by saying the CPEC benefits could only be materialised if the leadership consistently promotes consensus among the provinces and ensures development will occur in an equitable manner.


 
 

Triangular cold war

A TRIANGULAR cold war is developing which could be much more dangerous than the 20th-century Cold War. This new cold war ranges the US against Russia and China.

The US remains the world's number one military, S and T, economic and financial power. However, despite its global full-spectrum dominance, it is challenged in Europe and the Middle East by Russia, in East Asia by China, and in Central and South Asia by both.

The Pentagon officially says the 'long war' against international terrorism is drawing to a close. It argues 'the US must bolster its competitive military advantage relative to the threats posed by China and Russia' because 'inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in US national security'. It concludes 'the US-dominated global order today is challenged not by Al Qaeda and ISIS but by the aggressive behaviour of China and Russia'.

According to Prof Michael Clare 'a permanent campaign to contain Russia and China in Eurasia has begun. The US military has committed itself and the nation to a three-front geopolitical struggle to resist Chinese and Russian advances in Asia, Europe and the Middle East'. Centcom commander, Gen Votel, told the Senate 'the containment of China and Russia has become an integral part of Centcom's future strategic mission'. Of particular concern is 'the Chinese-managed port at Gwadar in Pakistan' which could contribute to 'China's military posture and force projection'.

What are the implications of a new cold war for Pakistan?

This answers questions why the US plans a long-term presence in Afghanistan and why it is concerned with Gwadar, CPEC and the Belt and Road Initiative. This is also the context within which it pressures Pakistan on Afghanistan, terrorism and its nuclear arsenal, and in which it has recruited India to its strategic camp.

The current spate of US and Western accusations against Russia and diplomatic expulsions increasingly seems an orchestrated prelude to a new cold war.

The US aims to sanction and isolate Russia into withdrawing from Ukraine and Syria, disengaging from its strategic embrace of China, abandoning its developing understanding with Iran and Turkey, and refraining from building a significant political presence in Afghanistan.

Russia may be economically vulnerable but militarily and politically it is strong. Moreover, Russians admire Putin because even if he has not delivered democracy and prosperity he embodies Russian defiance and resilience.

Russia has developed Sarmat 2 missiles which it claims the US cannot intercept. If true, it would have a nuclear first-strike capability. The US claims a similar capability. A US-Russian mutual first-strike capability is extremely destabilising.

In case of a serious military confrontation, neither side could risk not striking first. During the last cold war a shared second-strike capability helped avert such doomsday scenarios.

Despite mutual suspicion, China does not want Russia humiliated and destabilised by a US that regards China as its main adversary. The renewed American cold war with Russia and possible trade war with China brings both countries together.

The blustering Trump is a weak leader whom neither Moscow nor Beijing can trust to control his hawks. This is the opposite of what Nixon and Kissinger achieved. They exploited Sino-Soviet mistrust and enabled the US to become the preferred interlocutor for both China and Russia.

Today, according to Prof James Petras, 'while China exports economic products, the US exports arms and wars.

The US has a surplus of arms exports and a growing commercial deficit. China has multibillion-dollar infrastructure investments in over 50 countries that enhance trade surpluses. The US has multibillion-dollar expenditures in over 800 military bases that enhance trade deficits'.

Moreover, a 'trade war with China will result in higher prices for the US consumer, unskilled labour, war debts and financial monopolies. China will simply divert trade from the US to other countries and redirect its investments towards deepening its domestic economy and increasing ties with Russia, Asia, Africa, Latin America and Oceania'.

America's response is to rely on its military supremacy to compensate for its woeful diplomatic and economic strategies.

What are the implications of a new cold war for Pakistan? US demands to 'do more' will further escalate.

The US-Indian strategic alliance will deepen as the US remains distant and demanding towards Pakistan. India will progressively if not completely downgrade its strategic relations with Russia. It will bide its time with China which in turn will keep a door open to India, especially if Pakistan remains dysfunctional.

India would expect very significant transfers of military and development technology from the US and its allies, enabling it to eventually engage with China on less disadvantageous terms, at the expense of Pakistan.

Apart from these grave implications of a new cold war for Pakistan, the 21st century poses existential challenges that have been largely ignored by derelict governments and educationally and ethically challenged leadership, abetted by the narrow security focus of an overwhelming 'deep state'. Pakistan's population will be 400 million in 30 years.

Climate change threatens water scarcity and loss of agricultural land leading to widespread famine and disease. Human security is also threatened by deliberate underfunding for general, vocational and S and T education; generating family-supporting jobs in a global knowledge economy; providing adequate health and other basic services; developing institutional capacities and credibility; reforming the criminal justice and police systems; ensuring the rule of law; and guaranteeing human rights protections.

The government doesn't even want to know about these challenges. They can only be addressed by good governance at home; deeper geostrategic and geo-economic cooperation with China and Russia; good and substantive if non-strategic relations with the US based on addressing each other's concerns; a non-confrontational, dialogue-based and problem-solving working relationship with India despite outstanding differences and futile provocations; and developing mutual confidence with Afghanistan. I have suggested specific measures (see 'Who is listening?' in Dawn, Oct 9, 2017.)

Longer-term perspectives, rational mindsets, due diligence and honest common sense are what is required for policies to develop credibility, direction and momentum. Political and other non-civilian policy decision-makers should listen to and consider objective, professional and relevant advice and input.

Calling for reforms, transparency and strengthening regulatory mechanisms for industries, speakers at a session on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the economy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) on Saturday highlighted the need to ensure political and economic stability to invest in labour and to improve coordination between the Centre and the provinces so that Pakistan could harness the advantages of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

Nazish Afraz of LUMS spoke about special economic zones, which are to be built as a part of the CPEC, and what kind of policies would allow the government to attract investors. She identified certain areas which needed to be improved: access to finance, tax administration, inspection compliance, uninterrupted electricity supply, and contract enforcement, among others.

She urged the government to consider developing clusters of economic activity in a network centred on the main CPEC arteries, and compared the experiences of special economic zones in Shenzhen in China and in Senegal (Africa) and in Maharashtra in India.

'Investors consider investment incentives as icing on the cake, rather than as decisive factors when considering investing their money in another country,' she said, and suggested that the government consider dispensing back-loaded and performance-based incentives to investors rather than handouts.

At another session on the Geopolitics of the CPEC and BRI, William Case of the University of Nottingham shared the experiences of Malaysia to draw certain cautionary lessons for Pakistan. Warning about unfavourable terms of lending, he added that: 'China has always opposed democratic reform and doesn't need political stability to be a major factor in the countries it brings investments to.'

He also cautioned that through the BRI, China would leverage its economic dominance for democratic concessions, and warned of the possibility of a military coup in Pakistan.

Speaking about the possible impact of the BRI on Pakistan's foreign policy, Prof Yunas Samad said historically, Pakistan had structured its foreign policy mainly around the US, India and Afghanistan. It would be interesting to see how the BRI would impact regional security in the years to come.

The government is likely to replace retired Justice Javed Iqbal as the chairman of the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, commonly known as the missing persons' commission.

The matter was discussed in a federal cabinet meeting on Thursday chaired by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi at the Prime Minister's Secretariat.

A participant of the meeting who did not wish to be named told Dawn the interior minister had presented a summary before the cabinet seeking a replacement for Mr Iqbal, who has also been appointed chairman of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).

'The proposal said either the chairman of the missing persons' commission should be removed or another member of the commission should be inducted to increase the total number of its members to four,' he said.

Mr Iqbal was appointed chairman of the judicial commission mandated to trace missing persons in September 2011.

He also headed the Abbottabad Commission that was formed to look into a United States Navy Seals operation in Abbottabad in 2011 in which the US captured Osama bin Laden.

The meeting made other decisions, including granting permission to the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development to issue licenses to 54 overseas employment promoters to provide more opportunities to Pakistanis to work abroad.

The recommendation in this regard was made by the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment (BEOE).

The cabinet also approved the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the National Library of Pakistan and Cuba's National Library Jose Marti to strengthen cooperation between the two libraries.

The meeting accorded approval for the signing of a tripartite MoU between the National Transport Research Centre of Pakistan, China Highway and Transportation Society and Second Highway Consultants Company of China to conduct a study on international transport technology standards and specification systems, especially in those countries along the Belt and Road routes whose Pakistan-China portion is called the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

The cabinet approved the appointment of Lt Gen Sadiq Ali as chairman of the Pakistan Ordnance Factories Board, as well as the appointment of Dr Khawar Siddique Khokhar as National Institute of Electronics director general.

Tang Dynasty brought to life at Arts Council

The Tang Dynasty came to life at the Arts Council on Sunday where the Baoji Art Theatre Company performed the opening act to kick boff the CPEC Summit and Expo 2018.

Titled Tang Dynasty Songs and Dances: Impressions of Tang Dynasty, the poetry and dance of the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) were recreated to a mesmerised audience.

Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Xing shared his excitement at the performance and called it a re-demonstration of the spirit of the Tang Dynasty.

'At the time China was one of the most prosperous and powerful nations in the world. Through our historical records, the spirit of the Tang Dynasty was found to be about peaceful coexistence. It is known that diplomatic relations were established during the time with more than 300 states all over the world. The second spirit we have inherited from the Tang Dynasty is of mutual cooperation.'

Mr Xing explained that the Tang Dynasty's spirit of connectivity, especially through the Silk Road, allowed trade as well as cultural collaborations and people to people connectivity to thrive.

'China right now also wishes to rejuvenate this spirit by engaging this Belt and Road Initiative. I am very proud that CPEC is the frontrunner of this initiative and is the most result-oriented project.

'I appreciate the Pakistani government and the Pakistani people for their cooperation and enthusiasm. The CPEC summit will allow us to benefit from your assessment, your views and suggestions for better cooperation between China and Pakistan.'

CEO of Dawn Hameed Haroon called the performance the realisation of a 30-year-old dream. He recounted his visit in 1981 when he was invited by the government of the People's Republic of China to head a press delegation. During the trip he had the chance to see a performance of 'Tang Dynasty Songs and Dances'.

'This performance was created in a way which is exciting; it was a theatrical production but with sociological and art research aspects.'

The cultural heritage of the Tang Dynasty was lost following its fall and it was only with the discovery of the Tang Dynasty tombs that helped unearth paintings, murals and frescoes of the time to allow artists to recreate the culture, in particular the song and dance of the Tang Dynasty.

The first performance of the night was an ode to the flourishing age of the Tang Dynasty and was based in the courts where there was a sense of celebration of the dynasty and its diversity; the audience was also being welcomed to enter into a time of great economic prosperity when poetry, music and the performing arts were celebrated.

The dancers elegantly danced their way into the hearts of the audience; their gentle and elegant movements were not easy as their costumes were elaborate and a replication of the times they meant to portray. From instrumental performances to solo dances, there was plenty to showcase the different facets of life in the Tang Dynasty.

The performance 'The Ly Yao Melodies of the Tang Dynasty' was a remarkable segment, where different instruments were played and dancers performed alongside.

Among the instruments played was the Pipa, a four-stringed Chinese musical instrument, similar to a Chinese lute and is mostly used in solo instrumental performances.

Another instrumental was 'Zen and meditation', which was an attempt to attain nirvana through dance. The dancers took cues from the exceptional musicians and through their fluidity of movement vowed the audience.

The feather dress dance was a particular favourite, where fantasy was brought to life. Dancer Weng Wen, who was part of many of the performances of the night, simply stole the show.

'Women of Xi Fu' was a playful ode demonstrating symbolism of women, who are the epitome of beauty, wisdom and tolerance. This was a purely feminine expression which was a clear departure from the next performance, titled the Men of Guan Zhong, which had an all male ensemble and displayed masculine traits that were much touted and looked up to.

The final performance titled The Shaanxi Drum Dance was a stunning culmination of the colours of the Tang Dynasty.

Minister Ahsan Iqbal called the performance a sign of Karachi's revival of art and culture. 'This is a great beginning of a new era in Karachi. CPEC is an indicator of how the friendship between Pakistan and China is now higher than the stars.'

'Tang Dynasty Songs and Dances: Impressions of Tang Dynasty' will be staged at the Arts Council on April 23 and 24.

Prime Minis­ter Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said that with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) the time-tested ties and relationship between China and Pakistan have attained new heights that will evolve and grow for the betterment of the region and beyond.

Speaking at the CPEC Summit 2018 organised by the Dawn Media Group and the Ministry of Planning and Development with the participation of the Pakistan-China Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry at Bagh-i-Jinnah here on Monday, the prime minister said that just three years ago the CPEC had been an unknown word, but today it was known not only in Pakistan but all over the world.

He said that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) the vision of Chinese President Xi Jinping was the real push behind the cooperation mechanism of which the CPEC was an integral part today.

'It connects Western China with Pakistan and the sea as trade routes are developed not only within Pakistan but also Afghanistan, Central Asia and the West. So today, Afghanistan also recognises the benefits of CPEC. It is an opportunity for all the people living in this region,' the prime minister said.

Ahsan Iqbal says CPEC is not a debt trap, it is a partnership

'It is not just a partnership between two countries. It provides Pakistan with platform for development. Since President Xi Jinping has signed the agreement, CPEC is becoming a reality. Transmission lines are being laid. Highways, motorways and road networks are being developed as are railways. The special economic zones to build businesses and increase trade will be the fruits of CPEC,' he said, adding that several projects under the CPEC, including Thar coal, were already coming on line.

The prime minister said that principles of the CPEC had been designed keeping in view economic viability and environmental sustainability.

'The future programmes of CPEC would basically adhere to the vision of President Xi Jinping and the shared benefits and betterment of both countries,' he concluded.

Earlier, Minister for Interior and Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal said it was important to adopt new dynamics for the uplift of the country's economy.

'Today in this fast moving world, economies are defining the future of nations. Asia is becoming the new engine of growth in the world economy. It is estimated that by 2050 Asia will contribute 52 per cent to world GDP. South Asia, China and Central Asia where three billion people live are the new engines of growth. Pakistan has a great opportunity by being located at the intersection of these three engines of growth,' he said.

'If we can create economic corridors in this region, Pakistan can become a hub of trade, commerce and manufacturing for global supply chains to this part of the world,' he explained.

Mr Iqbal said they started the CPEC journey in 2013 when the Chinese premier visited Pakistan, met then prime minister Nawaz Sharif and discussed the idea of starting this new journey with Pakistan.

'The memorandum of understanding we signed on our visit to Beijing on July 5, 2013 was then only an intention on a piece of paper. But within a couple of years that piece of paper became the portfolio of 42 billion dollars of which 29 billion dollars have already been utilised on the Belt and Road Initiative of China,' he said.

Taking about the issue of people's reservations over the CPEC project, the minister said it would bring opportunities for Pakistan and all players of the region. He said the CPEC was not a dept trap but a partnership. 'It is all investment. There are no loans. There should be nothing to fear by Pakistan's businesses and there are 85 million jobs created too,' he cleared.

On the occasion, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing said they were looking at a new model of cooperation with Pakistan based on openness, inclusiveness and exclusiveness. 'China wants to see our relationship with Pakistan as a pillar, as a new era. CPEC is a very significant project not just for China and Pakistan but the entire world,' he said.

'For further development and cooperation, we are looking at all our neighbours and partners of which Pakistan is the most important. CPEC is a new model of partnership showing how we can deliver for the development of the whole Pakistani nation.

'There is the development of Gwadar Port in Balochistan, development of roads and highways and energy, too. CPEC demonstrates the devotion of both countries and regular connectivity of both nations,' he said.

Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said his government was fully geared up to derive maximum benefits out of the CPEC for people because it was not merely a road construction project but multi-sector development process which would transform the economic landscape of Pakistan.

He said the Sindh government was also focusing on removal of energy and infrastructure bottlenecks and, in collaboration with international agencies and other stakeholders, had finalised a comprehensive sector-wise development plan that encompassed both CPEC and non-CPEC initiatives for short-, mid- and long-term goals. 'This plan lays special emphasis on energy and infrastructure.'

Mr Shah said Sindh currently contributed 935MW of wind energy to the national grid from Jhimpir-Gharo-Keti Bandar wind corridor, while wind power projects of 300MW would be completed by October.

He said the CPEC offered innumerable opportunities for Sindh as its three major cities Sukkur, Hyderabad and Karachi had been declared key cities of the corridor. He said letters of intent had been issued to 35 companies for generation of 2,545MW of electricity. Besides Thar coal mining, two more such projects were in the pipeline, he added.

The chief minister said his government had put special efforts to make the $2bn Karachi Circular Railway project a part of the CPEC.

Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif stressed that the CPEC was not about provinces; it's about Pakistan's needs.

'When they visited China under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif soon after the 2013 elections it was to somehow secure energy projects which Pakistan badly needed. Power outages here were badly hurting our industry and progress so wherever we went to China, we talked about energy,' he said, adding that they were heard by Chinese President Xi Jinping which was the starting point of the CPEC.

'Delegations visited here and we visited them. China wanted to know our appetite and resolve. They don't have natural resources. Their resource is their hard-earned money. And their president had this vision of the Belt and Road Initiative, which resulted in CPEC,' he shared.

'Even though I am a great believer of China's development models, I didn't know then that the agreements signed in April 2015 will be put into action by May 2015. That's how the Sahiwal coal power project came about along with solar power projects and so on and so forth. We didn't know that the Chinese would go beyond energy and power but then there was the Gwadar project and CPEC.

'Some say that with CPEC Pakistan will become a colony of China or China will be like the East India Company. Those who say such things are enemies of Pakistan,' said the Punjab CM.

'It is not about domination. It is about development. It is about reaching out to the people and helping them stand on their own feet through wonderful economic progress,' he said, reminding how the CPEC would be a game changer for Pakistan.

'Pakistan has a huge youth bulge that can benefit from the opportunities coming this way thanks to CPEC. If not given any opportunities our youth will be pushed into a bloody revolution. So let's convert this society into a modern society, which is full of energy. CPEC is an opportunity for Pakistan and the Islamic world to lead from Casablanca to Kuala Lumpur,' he said.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Communications Akbar Ayub said that KP's policy reforms provided a sound foundation for CPEC projects, which have seen an increase in business activity with many business opportunities coming up.

'New and specialised institutes such as the KP Oil and Gas Company, KP IT Board, etc, provide one-window facilitation to foreigners. So there is an investment interest from a variety of companies in Asia for KP, and this is just the beginning,' he added.

Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Mir Hasil Khan Bizenjo said the CPEC would turn out to be a bright future for Pakistan and Balochistan. He said people didn't know what was the CPEC about as such they harboured reservations, but such conferences would contribute in dispelling their apprehensions.

Mr Bizenjo made it clear that he was not representing the Balochistan government but came here to express reservations of people about the CPEC. He said the CPEC originated due to Gwadar port and coastal area with second biggest naval port. He said that 43 per cent of Balochistan was full of minerals with second largest deposit of coppers and vast deposits of marble, green onyx, iron ore and gold.

'We are very initial stage of development, but this conference has given answers to many reservations of people,' he added.

Recalling his visit to Iran on the occasion of opening of Chabahar port, Mr Bizenjo said Iran wanted to have a link road between Chabahar and Gwadar and to upgrade Quetta-Zahidan road. He said the project would subsequently contribute to the development of the area.

Mushahid Hussain Syed, chairman of Pakistan-China Institute, said that out of the 43 CPEC projects in Punjab, 22 were on track, 21 had feasibility studies under way and $18.8bn had already been invested in infrastructure. About 19,581 Chinese experts were working on CPEC projects and 20,000 in non-CPEC projects as 25,000 Pakistanis were learning the Chinese language in Chinese universities, he added.


 
 

Ministry for logistics and transport suggested

International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA) President Babar Badat on Tuesday demanded a separate ministry for the logistics and transport sector for ensuring quick solutions and rapid growth of the industry.

Mr Badat was presiding over the 'Logistics' session on the last day of the two-day CPEC Summit and Expo organised by Dawn Media Group in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms and Pakistan-China Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

He said that currently the logistics industry had to run from one ministry to another to get the issues resolved. 'Once a separate ministry for logistics and transport is formed, the industry will get the work done in the shortest possible time which will allow for faster growth, he said.

Referring to a recent bill presented in the National Assembly on logistics, he said that it does not meet the present day challenges. The bill should be reviewed in consultation with the stakeholders, he stressed.

Pakistan is among the few countries of the world where there is no separate ministry for logistics and transport, he noted. The sector is an important link in the entire supply chain in the region after the launch of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and a separate ministry will become a focal point for the industry, he added.

Mr Badat said the Chinese companies should connect with local companies or enter into joint venture to handle transshipment or transit cargoes through Gwadar Port.

Participants at CPEC Summit say industry ready to face challenges

In a similar vein, International Chamber of Commerce Chairman Tariq Rangoonwala also stressed on the need for joint ventures between local and Chinese companies to enhance Pakistan's industrial base and productivity.

He hoped Pakistan will become a hub for transshipment trade once CPEC is fully on ground. Being a signatory to the TIR Convention, the customs connection on the international transport of goods under the cover of TIR Convention is an important link, he noted.

He disclosed that most of the Customs border posts including Gwadar, Taftan, Chaman, Turkham, Sust and the country's 12 dry ports are already TIR-compliant. 'Any cargo from Iran which has to go to China will move under the cover of this convention,' he added.

The customs posts are already linked electronically through WeBOC and there is no issue of compliance or connectivity under TIR. This will facilitate fast movement of transit and transshipment cargoes across the country.

Karachi Port Trust (KPT) Chairman Rear Admiral Jamil Akhtar said the port has all the potential and infrastructure to supplement CPEC. Presently the cargo handling share of the port has declined up to 60 per cent but the overall volume has increased and annually the port handles around 2.1 million containers, he noted.

Jamil said that after the establishment of Pakistan Deep Water Container Port, it could handle mother ships which presently go to Sallala and Jabal Ali from where feeder services come to Pakistan.

'Karachi port is ideal to serve western parts of China and Central Asian countries,' he added. However, he regretted that there was a missing link between CPEC and KPT.

Under CPEC, KPT could equally play its due role particularly when Pakistan would become a logistical hub and supply chain for South, Central and Western Asia, Middle East and Western China, he summed up.

Chairman Port Qasim Asad Rafi Chandna said the port - being 35km away from downtown - is ideally located for quick movement of cargo from and outside the port. It has strong industrial base and connectivity with major road links to upcountry.

'PQA has already started contributing towards CPEC projects as it houses some of the power plants set-up under the mega project and also coal terminal for supply of imported coal to Sahiwal coal run power plant. The port has become energy hub for the country where two LNG terminals are already operating,' he said.

Speaking on the occasion, Chairman China Overseas Port Holding Compnay Gwadar Port Zhang Baozhong said the Gwadar Port has already put logistics in place because transport is available, warehouses and customs have also started functioning.

Gwadar is strategically located port on one side is Suez Canal and other Malacca strait, he noted.

The first Free Economic Zone at Gwadar had been developed where more than 40 per cent of investment is Pakistani. Banks, insurance companies, and leasing firms are working in the zone which enjoys tax exemption, he added.

Mr Zhang said that Gwadar port will set up LNG and other terminals.

'Of the 500 people working there, only 13 are Chinese nationals. Out of 500 people, 50 per cent are locals from Balochistan,' he said

CEO Ghandhara Industries Ahmed Kuli Khan said the auto industry is ready to face the Belt and Road initiative (BRI), highlighting that the company could double its capacity in a short period. However, Mr Khan was not happy over the State Bank unwritten policy of not allowing banks to finance the auto industry.

Pakistan needs to modernise its trucking business and transport industry by introducing auto transmission and higher axle load with higher horse power. He further said CPEC is a big opportunity but only those vehicles be allowed to come from China which are not available in the local market.

CEO TCS Holdings Khalid Awan said that e-commerce and logistics are modern tools which speed up the progress of trade and business activity. E-commerce and logistics are integrated with everyday life of people and become part of people's life.

CEO TPL Corp Ali Jameel explained how technology can help monitor and regulate CPEC by checking pilferage of goods while in transit and also check if case any truck/vehicle loaded with goods/container deviate from its route. Currently only 60,000 containers move in transit trade but in post CPEC era this number could go into millions.

He further said that the CPEC corridor will go through the Karakoram mountains where geographic terrains are hazardous and presents numerous driving safety challenges but use of technology can also reduce these risks.

Project Director CPEC Hassan Daud said that as per the time line, he said, CPEC projects goal was given by 2020 to take its initial shape thereafter move to industrial activity and then move forward to agriculture which will be completed by 2025 and in 2030 CPEC would be completed and people to people contact will develop.

A local agriculture farm in collaboration with Chinese experts and the University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF) launched a research project involving 'One Belt One Road Water Saving Technology' (OBORWST) at Chak 8-P, Khanpur, some 54km from here on Tuesday.

The progressive farmers of Bilal Agriculture Farms, Arshad Javed and Bilal Arshad told journalists that because of increasing shortage of irrigation water and insufficient dams, agriculture sector was being adversely affected.

Mr Arshad said that to make for the irrigation water shortage at his farm he entered a joint venture with Chinese agriculture experts -- Prof Shun Yen Choyen, Prof Chao Chiya Shun and Dr Mun Lee Lee -- who visited Pakistan and the UAF. The Chinese experts and UAF jointly introduced a new technology that was used to cultivate crops with less water.

He said a the team of experts from China not only displayed the latest equipment used for the technology but also launched the three-year experimental research work on it.

He said the project would be a big achievement for the local agriculture sector and benefit the farmers.

The Chinese experts said OBORWST was a joint venture of Centre of Agriculture Resource Research, China, China Academy of Sciences, UAF and Bilal Farms.

They said it was a good sign that the initiative was taken by a farmer of a small city of southern Punjab.

They also gave a demonstration of the latest equipment used in OBORWST.

On the occasion, the visitors to the exhibition also chanted slogans lauding Pakistan, China friendship.

Local farmers presented traditional shawls (Ajrak) to the Chinese guests.

Pakistan would not have gained the publicity it gained from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) even if we spent millions in US dollars, said Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Wednesday.

Speaking at a seminar on 'Five Years of CPEC: A story of success and opportunities', the interior minister dismissed rumours that China is investing in CPEC because it wants to take over Pakistan.

'China has not occupied any land the last 3,000 years. It is an all-weather friend and cannot be compared with the East India Company,' he said.

'In 2013, no country was willing to invest even $10 in Pakistan but China decided to invest $46 billion,' he added.

CPEC is the biggest success story in Pakistan and has become Pakistan's brand globally, with think tanks across the world looking into it.

Says CPEC is the biggest success story and has become the country's brand globally

'This is the century of economic politics. We have missed the chance of becoming a developed country twice. Once in 1960s when even the South Korea was learning from Pakistan but we were involved in war and the second time in 1990s when Indian prime minister Narisimha Rao also borrowed our polices but democracy was derailed,'

he said.

Meanwhile, India implemented Pakistan's policies and went ahead of Pakistan, he added.

Similarly, Bangladesh borrowed policies from India and left us behind in 2013, the interior minister said.

'We can see how we missed the train. In 1980s, the per capita income in China was $200 and the per capita income in Pakistan was $300. Today, China's per capita income is $8,000 while that in Pakistan is $1,600,'

he said.

However, he said Pakistan's economy has seen a growth rate of 5.8pc which is the highest in the last 13 years.

'Soon, 85 million jobs will be moved here from China and it will be up to Pakistan how many of these jobs it grabs,' he said.

Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing said five years of construction, development and achievements is a very short time for the development of a relationship between two economies. However, he said, the two countries are moving towards a long-lasting relationship.

CPEC symbolises the strong cooperation and a new relationship between Pakistan and China, he added.

'In our view, CPEC is contributing to the new heights of state-to-state relationship of mutual respect,' he said.

CPEC is a 100pc success and China wanted to increase the production capabilities, building infrastructure and the strengthening of innovation and technical skills of Pakistan, the ambassador said.

Sustainable Development Policy Institute Executive Director Dr Abid Qayyum Suleri said China's Belt and Road Initiative is about creating a shared future and that CPEC is one of its great successes.

Dr Suleri said political volatility, capacity, coordination, institutional trust, knowledge gaps, financing and flexibility in our policies are major challenges that may hinder the progress of CPEC. He said we are living in the era of economic diplomacy; where we should collaborate rather than compete.

Deputy Head of Mission China Li Jihan Zaho said that the rumours regarding CPEC being another East India Company are ridiculous and urged international investors to invest in Pakistan's emerging economy.

The event was organised by the Ministry of Planning and Development and the Embassy of China.

Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said that Pakistan's economy can achieve a growth rate of nine per cent if it fully benefits from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

He was speaking at an international maritime symposium titled, 'Impact of BRI on the geo-economics of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR); prospects for Pakistan, the region and beyond' on Monday.

The symposium was organised by Bahria University's Institute of Maritime Affairs.

The prime minister said that CPEC and the connectivity it provided were critical for economic growth of the country, but emphasised that hard work would have to be put in to exploit the potential of this vital trade corridor.

He reminded attendees of the symposium about the huge network of six-lane motorways and multi-lane secondary routes that the country was developing to achieve that objective.

Mr Abbasi said that maritime sector had to play a crucial role in availing this great opportunity that had come Pakistan's way in the form of CPEC and one that envisioned regional connectivity and unimpeded trade.

He also spoke of the unta­pped potential of Pakistan's 'exclusive economic zone', which he reminded was almost 40 per cent of the country's land mass.

About maritime concerns, the prime minister said: 'We are well aware of security concerns of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

'There is a need for collaborative response mechanism to deal with security threats to keep the IOR economically a thriving region,' Mr Abbasi said.

He commended the role the Pakistan Navy and other armed forces were playing to ensure maritime security.

Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi said that IOR had been a global geo-political chessboard and one of the core drivers of the world's prosperity. However, he said, over the past few decades, it had witnessed a seismic shift at the geo-strategic level, adding that while this shift was initially security focused, the Belt and Road Initiative was transforming it into geo-economics.

He called for attending to traditional and non-traditional security threats that necessitated effective security, proactive diplomacy, well-considered economic policies and risk management as important ingredients to exploit and sustain the pace of development and potential growth.

The federal planning secretary has said that the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) project and the upgrading of the Pakistan Railways' ML-I (Karachi-Lahore-Peshawar railway track) project will be implemented in the current phase of CPEC as these are the main focus areas in transport and infrastructure sector.

In a meeting with vice president of China Railway Construction Corporation Limited (CRCC) Yang Jinjun here on Tuesday, planning secretary Shoaib Ahmad Siddiqui said that the ML-I was strategically important while the KCR was an economically viable project.

'The projects have made headway and will start soon,' he said adding that there was a need for efficient and professional firms to build these mega projects at fast pace.

The secretary further highlighted that the policies of President Xi Jinping were taking China to new development stage through Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

'CPEC is the main pillar of the BRI that helped Pakistan to achieve economic growth of 5.8 per cent last year,' Mr Siddiqui added.

It was emphasised that Chinese firms should ensure capacity building of the local manpower by providing them on-job training and employment.

The officials also invited the attention of the CRCC to explore investment opportunities offered by special economic zones being implemented under CPEC.

Yang Jinjun expressed his full support to implement mega infrastructure projects in Pakistan with commitment and speed.

The CRCC informed that the company was already working in Pakistan and was interested in expending cooperation in infrastructure and industrial development sectors. The firm also expressed its commitment to work closely with Pakistan's technical education institutes to ensure capacity-building of local youth and more employment in future.

National security adviser Nasser Khan Janjua on Sunday said US and the West should play a positive role in maintaining security of the region that has become quite fragile.

He was speaking at an international conference, 'Media opportunities and challenges' organised by the Associated Press of Pakistan at a local hotel.

'Afghanistan is a story of pains. It is a story of injuries. It is a wound of the world and also of region which should be healed as quickly as possible. Every investment has been made to win Afghan war but, unfortunately, we have not invested in winning peace.'

Fighting the Taliban: The US and Pakistan's failed strategies

Every investment has been made to win Afghan war but, unfortunately, we have not invested in winning peace, says national security adviser

He said innocent people in both Afghanistan and Pakistan had been suffering since the Soviet occupation of Kabul in 1979. But now, he said, peace was the only way forward.

Mr Janjua said the post-9/11 Pakistan stood with the international community, not with those who inflicted an atrocious attack on the US. On the prevalent blame game, he said: 'It is a strange moment in our history that the US and all others are blaming us that we are supporting the militants.'

He added: 'The Taliban accuse us of supporting the US and vice versa. So both are blaming us, who's right?'

He also discussed the role of Pakistan in recent history and the sacrifices rendered by Pakistan in ongoing war against terrorism, saying Pakistan had lost over 60,000 lives and billions of dollars in the war.

The security adviser said Pakistan's location made it a strategic asset in Central and South Asia, having the ability to connect the markets of Europe, Africa and other parts of Asia.

He said CPEC was only half of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) dream with Afghanistan being the other half as it would connect whole Central Asia and Europe.

Mr Janjua said Pakistan was totally different compared to the perception about it.

'Let us face the biggest question how Pakistan is seen from abroad. What are our security challenges and what are preventions. We are a poor country and are suffering of terrorism. We are nuclear country and there is fear that our nuclear weapons can go in the hands of terrorists. We are also blamed for double game with Afghanistan,' he said.

'But there is also another picture of Pakistan that it is a beautiful country. Our northern areas mesmerise people. Your countries are beautiful but ours is no less.'

Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb said the government had done legislation on the right to information (RTI) and access to information and now there was a need for legislation on cyber security.

Cyber security comprises technologies, processes and controls that are designed to protect systems, networks and data from cyber attacks. Effective cyber security reduces the risk of cyber attacks, and protects organisations and individuals from the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks and technologies.

Ms Maryam said Pakistan's 60pc population was youth that had been actively using social media.

Since 2005, along with electronic media, social media also become popular and dependence on it is increasing. She said during the last 70 years the media had become free and vibrant. Moreover, for the first time there have been 10 years of uninterrupted democracy in the country.

'We are also fighting a war of perception. On the other hand, the race for breaking news has created the issue of 'fake news'. However, the media is also passing through the process of evolution so things will improve with the passage of time.'

She said the media should highlight the benefits of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it would change the fate of the region.

The centre of economic power is shifting to the east, and Asia has become a leading player in the emerging economies of the world over the years, Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Sartaj Aziz said on Monday.

Mr Aziz was speaking at a seminar on 'Dynamics of Geo-Politics, Regional Security and Economic Connectivity', organised by the government's National Security Division (NSD) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS).

He said Pakistan stands at a historic juncture, and the country's strategic location, once a liability, is now a bridge between Europe and Asia.

'Regional connectivity in Asia now lies at the centre of the Chinese-led Belt and Road initiative which aims to connect Asia with Europe and CPEC,' he said.

Central Asian republics should benefit from Balochistan's potential, says national security adviser

National Security Adviser Nasser Khan Janjua said that Pakistan by connecting 86pc (as 60pc of the world's population lives in Asia; about 10pc in Europe and 16pc in Africa) of the people of the world is a massive potential trade and industrial hub.

He urged the Central Asian republics (CAR) to utilise the huge potential of Balochistan and access the sea through Gwadar, which is the world's largest deep sea port. Balochistan is our face, he added. Pakistan will multiply the economy of the entire region.

Ambassador of Azerbaijan to Pakistan Ali Alizada said that the landscape of the world is changing dramatically and countries are changing their state policies swiftly in the wake of unfolding global crescendos.

'Peace is the only option to move towards sustainable future. Pakistan has always backed peace and stability in the region and Azerbaijan is grateful to Pakistan for positive role in this regard,' he said.

Giving Turkey's perspective, Prof Erhan Dogan from Marmara University, Istanbul, stated that Turkey has some regional calculations and some international.

What China, the United States and Russia envisage their role in other parts of the world definitely has significant impact over Turkey's equation with the world.

Kazakh Ambassador Barlybay Sadykov said confidence building measures should remain on the top agenda in order to maintain global security and ensure peace.

He said international terrorism is a common threat and requires a collective response.

Uzbek Ambassador Furqat A. Sidiqov said Gwadar was very important for Uzbekistan as the country needs access to warm waters.

Furthermore, stability in Afghanistan is pivotal for both CARs and Pakistan to strengthening economic connectivity of the region.

Tajik Ambassador Sherali Jononov was of the view that the response to global and regional challenges requires broad dialogue and concerted efforts of the entire international community.


 
 

Muslim unity?

Huma Yusuf

OUR prime minister on Friday joined leaders from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to condemn the recent violence in Gaza, the 'brutal' and 'criminal' actions of Israel, and the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem. Our prominent role in the special meeting fits the religio-nationalist mood that has gripped Pakistan in recent years; its simple messaging resonating with our righteous patriots: up with the Muslim world, down with the US and Israel.

But indignant fist thumping cannot mask the truth. Saudi Arabia has sided with Israel in efforts to undermine Iran and check its regional ambitions. The Gulf Cooperation Council remains at loggerheads a year into the dispute. The Saudi-led conflict in Yemen rages, fuelling one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times. The horrors in Syria seem endless. Sectarian hatred is deeply entrenched across the Muslim world, with particularly violent ramifications in the Middle East.

The anti-US posturing is also ambivalent at best. While condemnation of the embassy move has been almost universal encompassing not only members of the OIC but also many European and Asian countries the rejection of US policies is hardly that resolute. Washington and Riyadh, for example, are enjoying revitalised relations spurred on by mutual suspicion of Iran (and Saudi Arabia's dispute with Qatar, a US ally, has barely registered as a bone of contention).

The weakness of the OIC is reflected in the outcome of last week's meeting. All the outrage cumulated in a plan to express solidarity with the Palestinians and lobby other countries not to move their embassies to Jerusalem hardly a game plan to tackle the worsening plight of the Palestinians.

The sound and fury of the OIC meeting highlights our challenges.

The sound and fury of the OIC meeting highlights the challenges ahead for Pakistan. At a point when our Foreign Office is faltering as pointed out by Moeed Yusuf in these pages, writing about the snub our new US ambassador's appointment represents for the diplomatic corps we seem ill equipped to navigate the complex foreign policy landscape of the Middle East.

A show of Muslim unity serves to accentuate the fact that one of Pakistan's trickier foreign policy puzzles is simultaneously managing relations with Saudi Arabia and Iran. Much has already been written about the need for Pakistan to juggle the relationships to prevent a return to the proxy sectarian war of the 1990s, and to continue to benefit from both Saudi benefactors and the opportunities for trade, energy connectivity and counterterrorism cooperation that Iran offers closer to home. This need is more urgent since America's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.

In the event that European efforts to save the deal fail, Tehran would likely resume its nuclear programme. That in turn could stir Saudi aspirations of becoming a nuclear power. In this scenario, Pakistan could face pressure to support such a move with all its implications.

The failure of the Iran nuclear deal could also present Pakistan with a new juggling act. Our typically binary foreign policy calculations make much of our tilt away from the US, and into China's arms. But what if the US decides to push its attempts to weaken Iran further, either by targeting Iranian nuclear facilities in conjunction with Israel, or seeking regime change, as certain White House officials have hinted is the ultimate goal? In that scenario, Saudi Arabia would back America's aggressive anti-Iran posturing, while China, which has opposed the US's withdrawal from the agreement, would see an opportunity to strengthen ties with Tehran, drawing it further into the Belt and Road Initiative. How would Pakis­tan manage the competing interests of its key allies?

All this would be further complicated by the fact that Pakistan in some ways benefits from the collapse of the deal, despite our initial official statements in support of Iran. Further obstructions to doing business with Iran will limit the competition for Gwadar from Chabahar, and also stymie India's plans to trade with Afghanistan via Iran. Seen this way, Pakistan is more aligned with the US than it would like to seem.

There's also a domestic angle to consider. Pakistan's support for Palestinians is ethical and necessary. But there's a twinge of hypocrisy in our vehement condemnation of the human rights violations and brutal killings of Palestinians gathering in opposition to unjust policies. After all, closer to home, Pakistani citizens who gather to protest killings, displacement and humiliation are met with intimidation and media blackouts.

The idea of Muslim unity in the face of gross injustices may be a beautiful one. But there is little beauty in our world today. And Pakistan seems ill prepared to protect its interests and those of all its citizens in the midst of growing complexities.

Acting President Mohammad Sadiq Sanjrani said on Tuesday highlighted the need for a joint strategy to counter a narrative against the China Pakistan Economic Corridor and China-Pakistan relations.

Mr Sanjrani, who is also the Senate chairman, was speaking to a Chinese parliamentary delegation at the President House. The delegation was led by the vice chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Kong Quan.

He said Pakistan wants peace in the region and would continue to support efforts aimed at regional and global peace and stability.

He said the One Belt One Road initiative and vision of shared prosperity would make Asia the epicentre of socioeconomic power.

However, he said, the West is not comfortable with these developments, as a shift in power to the east would place Asia at the centre stage of global politics, spearheaded by China.

He said the relationship between China and Pakistan had stood against all odds and ups and downs.

'This uniqueness makes it a corner stone of our foreign policy and we, as a nation, take pride in our friendship with China' he added.

He said the historic relationship has entered a strategic, cooperative partnership that would prove to be an anchor for regional peace and stability.

He expressed satisfaction with the progression of CPEC and said the project enjoys an across the board consensus on all of Pakistan's political fronts.

He added that Pakistan is facing unemployment, a shortfall of electricity and an economic crunch due to low industrial growth, and CPEC would be a ray of hope for both countries.

Mr Sanjrai also appreciated that the CPEC energy and infrastructure projects are being completed and implemented within the stipulated period.

He hoped for progress on the Gwadar project, including the Gwadar international airport, and that social welfare projects with active Chinese assistance would be accelerated.

He said special economic zones (SEZ) needed special attention from the Chinese leadership because they would play a crucial role in taking CPEC to the next level, and called for robust participation by state-owned Chinese enterprises and the private sector in SEZs.

The acting president called on leaders of the Pakistani business community and trade delegates to participate in an international trade exhibition in China this November.

The head of the Chinese delegation, agreeing with Mr Sanjrani, assured that steps would be taken to further improve trade between both countries.

Mr Sanjrani said: 'I am looking forward to my visit to China in July 2018 and hope that my upcoming visit to China will further strengthen the existing bilateral parliamentary relations.'

A special event was organised by Pakistan on Thursday during the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva in order to find a way forward for countries to take concrete measures in improving access to assistive technology. Pakistan was supported in hosting the event by China, Italy and Iraq, according to a press release issued by the Ministry of National Health Services.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that today, more than a billion people need one or more assistive products. With a global ageing population and a rise in non-communicable diseases, this number will rise to over two billion by 2050, with many older people needing two or more products as they age. However, only one in 10 people in need currently have access to devices.

Pakistani Ambassador and a permanent representative of the UN in Geneva, Farukh Amil presided over the event which was also attended by Director General Health Dr Assad Hafeez.

The event was attended by a large number of heads of country delegations, leading global institutions and INGOs.

Pakistan hosts meeting on assistive devices at World Health Assembly

Mr Amil said Pakistan being able to lobby for assent of the WHO Executive Board for tabling a resolution on the subject in the current assembly was a success.

'This is a victory for the one billion people across the globe living with various kinds of disabilities,' he said.

Dr Hafeez said the cause was championed at all global and regional forums by Federal Health Minister Saira Afzal Tarar and that Pakistan has been consistently pursuing it.

We need to ensure that countries commit to improving access to assistive products for those in need, he added.

WHOs first global champion for assistive technologies, Pakistani doctor Sana Hafeez also spoke at the event about her experience of meeting with an accident which left her physically disabled and how it inspired her to raise a voice for those who need assistive devices.

Sana Hafeez was a medical student when she suffered injuries to her spinal cord in an accident. However, she continued with her education and became a doctor.

Tajikistan Deputy Health Minister Dr. Aziz Abdosattar Odinazoda pledged full support for the cause.

Vice President of Chinese Disabilities Federation Jia Yong and Li Xi head of the China Assistive Devices and Technology Centre spoke on the occasion and shared the work undertaken by China in this important area. They pledged unflinching support of their organizations in developing industry to manufacture assistive products for persons with disabilities in countries part of China's Belt and Road Initiative.

WHO Deputy Director-General Dr. Soumya Swaminathan reiterated the commitment of WHO Headquarters for supporting member states in developing the strategic roadmap for improving access to assistive technology.

Terming the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) future of regional development, Balochistan Governor Muhammad Khan Achakzai said that after its completion the project would make the country a hub of trade and economic activities.

'CPEC is part of People's Republic of China's One-Belt One-Road initiative which will connect the world's economic and trade activities as well as provide alternate land route to Central Asia and Middle East.'

'There are many expectations from CPEC,' he said while speaking to Ambassador of China Yao Jing at the Governor House.

Mr called for utilising the vast opportunities through collective measures at regional level. 'Pakistan and China are bonded in friendly relations which will strengthen with the passage of time'.

'Balochistan is rich in natural resources and has a high geographical importance, which will create opportunities for investment and trade', Governor said.

The ongoing development work, water crises, establishment of modern industries in the province and regional situation would also be part of dialogue during the meeting.

Balochistan is vast in terms of land but its population is scattered, he said adding the province would provide connectivity through land route to Central Asia.

Ambassador Yau jing appreciated the Governor for expressing warm wishes and said that China sees Pakistan's friendship close to its heart. China seeks collaboration with Pakistan in the implementation of projects like CPEC.

Chinese ambassador also briefed Governor about the ongoing CPEC projects and future plans in the development sector.


 
 

'Manageable aggression'

FOR most people in India and Pakistan, anticipating peace between the two countries is akin to daydreaming. Those who still believe in the dream of amity have few followers. The absence of peace, however, does not always mean war or a medium-scale conflict. Sometimes it also means a low-scale conflict with 'manageable aggression'; to some, this appears relatively more debilitating.

The power elites on both sides have apparently become used to non-peace, which makes it harder to break out of the cycle of manageable aggression. Both sides have their formal and informal channels intact, which helps in preventing the conflict from escalating. Track-II diplomacy is one such channel of unconventional diplomacy, which keeps opening communication channels for formal diplomacy. Track-II channels are usually activated when formal diplomatic channels fail to keep up the momentum of the status quo.

However, in most cases, Track-II remains an autonomous process. It tends to influence policy establishments in two ways: first, it facilitates the formal diplomatic discourse; and second, it gives options for the de-escalation of violence and/or the resolution of conflict. Establishments normally tolerate and in some cases support Track-II for the former objective, but they may not always encourage the outcome of the latter.

The publication of The Spy Chronicles: RAW, ISI and the Illusion of Peace, authored by retired Gen Asad Durrani, former RAW chief Amarjit Singh Dulat and journalist Aditya Sinha could become a unique case of Track-II diplomacy as it has connected the most critical components of the two countries' security establishments. As expected, it has sparked a reaction. The conversation of the former spies, who remained active members of the Track-II dialogue, encourages peace-dreamers in Pakistan and India to come up with more such efforts. Mr Durrani and Mr Dulat have attempted to find spaces for dialogue and hinted at a few possible ways out. Mr Dulat sees no benefit for India in maintaining the status quo in Kashmir, while Mr Durrani believes that Pakistan should have engaged with political actors such as Amanullah Khan, the president of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front, instead of being seen as backing the Lashkar-e-Taiba. They advocate resumption of the composite dialogue as the only way to de-escalate tensions between the two states.

The power elites on both sides have apparently become used to non-peace.

As cited earlier, one of the purposes of Track-II is to facilitate Track-I of bilateral diplomacy. But diplomacy between India and Pakistan has largely remained victim to the manageable aggression doctrine. The composite dialogue, which is a premium Track-I initiative between the two countries, was first initiated in 1985 with a four-point agenda that included Siachen, Sir Creek, terrorism and commercial ties. Later, it was expanded to eight points in 1997 to also include Kashmir and the Wullar Barrage in the wish list. In 2004, both sides made a renewed commitment to restart the composite dialogue process after the declaration from Pakistan that no militant group would be allowed to use its soil against India. In December 2015, both sides made yet another effort to resume talks on all outstanding issues. This process has remained a non-starter during the last three years because of the civil-military rift in Pakistan and the changing regional scenario.

Interestingly, Track-II has always played an important role in the resumption of Track-I. For one, composite dialogue was resumed on the eve of Saarc regional summits, where Track-II lobbyists found an opportunity to influence their leaders. Just a few weeks before the release of Spy Chronicles, Pakistan hosted the Neemrana Dialogue, an old Track-II initiative between India and Pakistan, which as seen as an indication that both sides may come to Track-I soon.

Also, statements of the army chief and the former national security adviser Nasser Khan Janjua and others gave the impression that Pakistan was ready for talks with India and this intention was reciprocated by the other side. The recent decision of the directors general of military operations to fully implement the ceasefire understanding of 2003 was another indication of such inclination.

It is no secret that China is encouraging dialogue not only between India and Pakistan but also between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The reason is obvious: regional stability is key for the success of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are utilising formal and informal communication channels to avoid any Doklam-like crisis. China encourages Pakistan to take similar measures.

It is interesting that in the recently announced national internal security policy review, Pakistan has conceived itself as a transit state between Central and South Asia and come up with its own connectivity approach to complement OBOR and maximise CPEC advantages. If this is going to translate into policy, Pakistan will need a different sort of diplomacy. So far, its formal diplomatic channels are not functioning well. The expansion of Track-II initiatives with Afghanistan and the US is an indication of internal weaknesses. Track-II is encroaching on the realm of formal diplomacy. Recently, it has contributed towards de-escalating tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which has resulted in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity.

China is also initiating such measures and encouraging Track-II dialogue between India and Pakistan, and in a few cases, between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Chinese think tanks and academic institutions are increasingly inviting scholars, policymakers and opinion-makers from these countries and encouraging free and frank dialogue amongst the participants.

It is not certain whether or not Chinese efforts will culminate in breaking the cycle of manageable aggression, but at least they have expanded the scope of unconventional diplomacy in the region. China is an important factor in the success of Afghanistan-Pakistan unconventional diplomacy. However, India's case is complicated as it remains to be seen whether or not Pakistan's security establishment is ready to come out of the trap of manageable aggression.


 
 

Foreign policy challenges

A coherent, well-formulated and popularly supported foreign policy is essential, especially in an age of globalisation when new and daunting challenges have emerged. Foreign policy cannot be seen in isolation, for it is only a reflection of a country's domestic policy.

The two are linked inextricably, as foreign policy cannot be effective and credible unless backed by a domestic policy that promotes harmony and good governance at home.

The preceding sentences are drawn from the PML-N's electoral manifesto in 2013. They make for sensible reading. But 'National Security and Foreign Policy' was only the 12th section in the PML-N manifesto of 14 parts.

And while the measures and initiatives the PML-N pledged to undertake were mostly non-controversial, attempting to assert itself in the national security and foreign policy domains proved disastrous for the PML-N government, and may have contributed to Nawaz Sharif's ouster.

In hindsight, the collision between the military-led establishment and the Sharif-led PML-N government may have been foretold in the party's election manifesto. 'Pakistan today is at war within, while isolated abroad,' the 2013 manifesto stated. 'Consequently, a deep malaise afflicts the country; its social, economic and political schisms creating grave doubts and misgivings even in the minds of our friends.'

In 2018, the challenges in the national security and foreign policy domains remain numerous and complex. But there are significant opportunities too. Whichever party or coalition takes charge of the federal government after the elections, the conduct of foreign policy will be fundamental to its success.

The internal dimension i.e. managing civil-military relations will perhaps be as important as the external dimension. Ultimately, much will depend on how Pakistan manages its ties with four countries: China, the US, Afghanistan and India.

China is central to Pakistan's medium-term economic future. As a maturing world power, its importance in regional security will grow.

With CPEC an original pillar of the Belt and Road Initiative, many of the early CPEC-related projects set to mature during the next parliament's term and Pakistan almost certainly needing external financial aid, the economic dimension of the relationship will need further attention.

In particular, the growing criticism that the PML-N government was unnecessarily secretive and opaque in agreements reached with China and that the commercial terms of many agreements may not be favourable to Pakistan need to be addressed.

Surely, given both states' commitment to strong bilateral ties, an economic rebalancing can be achieved in a constructive manner.

In addition, Pakistan should heed the well-meaning Chinese advice that the regional security environment be improved.

The Chinese examples of developing robust trade ties with India and not allowing the Doklam stand-off to derail ties are instructive.

The growing economic and military strength of South and West Asia and of regional countries should be seen as an opportunity for engagement for Pakistan just as China has done.

The deepening of Pakistan's ties with China contrasts poorly with the worsening of ties with the US. President Donald Trump has proved as disruptive as candidate Trump had promised, and in the case of Pakistan, there has been a downturn in ties.

America's so-called South Asia strategy announced in 2017 and Mr Trump's New Year Day tweet combined with the state here bristling at the tone and substance of some of the American accusations against it have caused ties to further deteriorate.

If there is to be improvement, it will almost certainly centre on Afghanistan. There Pakistan continues to have a historic opportunity to help put an end to what next year will be 40 years of near-continuous war.

The next government's focus should be to work with the military leadership to help achieve a political settlement in Kabul with the Afghan Taliban. Lasting stability in Afghanistan is the stated desired outcome for all actors and it is within the realm of possibility.

Finally, India.

Recent overtures by our military leadership should be taken seriously and the civilian government that takes charge after the election should move quickly to try and restore dialogue with India.

It is not clear if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will easily accept a fresh Pakistani outreach to his government, but the logic of engagement and dialogue must eventually prevail.

All this will hopefully be reflected in the new manifestos. May the next government achieve more than its predecessors on the foreign policy front.


 
 

History's geopolitical pivot

IN his 1904 treatise, The Geographical Pivot of History, Halford Mackinder theorised that whoever controls the Eurasian heartland from the Volga to the Yangtze and the Himalayas to the Arctic would control the world. Soon after, Nicolas Spyman countered with the thesis that whoever controlled Eurasia's rim would control the heartland and the world.

Hitler's decision to open the eastern front against the Soviet Union and the Cold War contest for control of Central and Eastern Europe were heavily influenced by these theories. The demise of the Soviet Union saw Nato move eastward as the US asserted its global dominance. America's unipolar moment (1992-2003) began to erode after its disastrous 2003 invasion of Iraq. Since then, power has pivoted towards the Eurasian heartland.

The most important reason for this shift is the rise of China. At no time in history has any nation brought so many people out of poverty as quickly as has China. It will soon be the world's largest economy and the second military power. Simultaneously, Russia has risen from the ashes. It is again a military match for Nato, the dominant power in Central Asia and a critical player in the Middle East and increasingly in South Asia.

Significantly, China and Russia have established a strategic partnership, symbolised by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) whose latest summit is being held in China.

Since the US invasion of Iraq, power has pivoted towards the Eurasian heartland.

The heartland powers aim to extend their influence westward to cover the rest of Eurasia. Several European countries (Hungary, Poland, Greece, Italy, Austria) desire closer relations with Russia. Seventeen European countries have formed a group to promote economic cooperation with China under its Belt and Road Initiative (which will extend to European ports on the Atlantic)

With the heartland under Chinese and Russian control, the focus of strategic competition with the US now is the entire Eurasian Rim: southern Europe, Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia. The European pillar of the American security order is in disarray. The expansion of the European Union is frozen; the UK has exited; southern Europeans are unhappy with the single currency; Turkey is alienated from Nato and the EU; mass migration from the Middle East and Africa has revived racism and eroded European unity. The recent unilateral US trade tariffs, its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and threatened sanctions against Europeans doing business with Tehran, will further weaken the Atlantic alliance.

America's credibility in the Middle East is on the wane. Russia has carved an important role for itself. Iran has consolidated its influence in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Despite the defeat of the militant Islamic State group, anti-US Muslim extremism has intensified, especially after the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the virtual jettisoning of the two-state solution.

Propelled by Israel, the US seems headed towards a conflict with Iran which could engulf the entire region. Whatever the outcome, the US is likely to become further mired in the Middle East morass. Russia and China will gain by default. Indeed, given their ability to work with Tehran, Tel Aviv and Riyadh, they may be able to restore some semblance of order in the region.

The Sino-US competition in East Asia is escalating. While seeking its help to denuclearise North Korea, the US disinvited China from the annual multination Pacific Rim naval exercises (ostensibly for landing a bomber on one of its claimed South China Sea islands). At the recent Shangri-La Dialogue, the US defence secretary declared the US will continue its freedom of navigation forays close to the islands and take further steps to challenge China's maritime claims. The US intends to send a warship through the Taiwan Strait which is certain to provoke a strong Chinese reaction.

However, the aims of the Obama pivot to Asia to build a ring of alliances around China's periphery and exclude it from a Pacific trade partnership are unlikely to be realised. Trump has withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and no Asean member is prepared to confront China. Nor are the three other members of the US-led anti-China quad Japan, Australia or India prepared to do so. In the final analysis, America itself is unlikely to risk war with China, eg by blocking access to its claimed islands or encouraging Taiwan to declare independence .

The contest in South Asia is also complex. For decades, China's strategic partnership with Pakistan has maintained a balance of power in the subcontinent. Since 2005, the US has sought to recruit India as a partner to contain China's rising power in Asia. The South Asia policy outlined by the Trump administration seeks to maintain the US military and geopolitical presence in Afghanistan and promote an Indo-US security order in South Asia.

China and Russia's endeavour is to prevent India's complete military alignment with the US. India has tried to play both sides of the field. Although the US renamed its Pacific Command as the Indo-Pacific Command to acknowledge India's importance, Prime Minister Modi, while endorsing the freedom of navigation principle at the Shangri-La Dialogue, also underlined the importance of India's cooperation with China.

Beijing and Moscow no doubt hope that the entry of Pakistan and India as full members of the SCO will facilitate the normalisation of their relations and draw India closer to the Sino-Russian sphere and autonomous from America. This is likely to be a long, uncertain game.

Today's interdependent world is vastly different from Mackinder's era of competing empires. The current geopolitical rivalry will be heavily conditioned by several global and shared challenges: unprecedented technological development, new weapons and concepts of warfare, the growing role of non-state actors, the population explosion, climate change and the manifest failure of global and regional institutions to respond to these challenges.

The shape of the new world order will depend in considerable measure on the evolution of the relationship between China and the US. Their national interests can be served more by cooperation than confrontation. Sino-US strategic confrontation could lead to instability in several regions if not a global disaster; their cooperation could accelerate trade, investment, global growth and prosperity for all peoples: in the heartland, the Eurasian Rim and beyond.


 
 

The dream of connectivity

PAKISTAN is a nation still in search of a vision that would lucidly describe its strategic, geo-economic and sociocultural aspirations. It also needs to develop a unique and strong nationalistic character. Sadly, though new ideas might inspire the country's power elites, they lack the courage and self-belief to put those ideas into action.

Western scholars describe the behaviour of Pakistan's power elites in many ways, ranging from revisionist to futuristic. But it has several inherent contradictions that one can see in the form of paradoxes the state is still struggling to resolve. Ever since China launched its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which promises enormous geo-economic and strategic benefits for Pakistan, the idea of regional connectivity is gaining more currency among its power elites.

Many see the idea of connectivity as a remedy for all the country's economic and geopolitical issues. They suggest developing compatible national policies in a manner that maximises the benefits of emerging connectivity. However, while the idea of BRI is to prop up the global economy with China at its heart, Pakistan's self-placement in BRI-linked connectivity ie, in form of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is that of a transit state.

Many see regional connectivity as a remedy for all our economic and geopolitical issues.

A transit state has its own advantages and disadvantages. But can it change the nationalistic character of a society, transform it ideologically, and change its worldview? This question requires an in-depth inquiry; some Western analysts may see in BRI an opportunity for Pakistan to review its revisionist credentials. Seen in Pakistan's context, it is difficult to plainly describe how it would look like as a regionally connected and transit country. The question touches upon the country's core strategic design and its relation with its neighbours, especially with India and Afghanistan.

Pakistan's former national security adviser (NSA), retired Lt Gen Nasser Janjua, who resigned from his office on Wednesday, contributed greatly in developing Pakistan's vision of regional connectivity. He was assigned by the former prime minister to develop Pakistan's first National Security Policy (NISP). Janjua's interactions with the media and think tanks, and deliberations at strategic forums, suggest that he conceived Pakistan as a globally and regionally connected transit state. In his latest interaction with media and civil society in Islamabad, he underlined the significance of Pakistan's geography, and the advantages of connecting with South and Central Asia, including through the Indian Ocean.

The NISP draft for 2018-2023 has also assigned regional connectivity as one of its main pillars. A change in the state's strategic mindset can only be assessed after analysing the new government's response to the former NSA's national security policy as well as NISP. Optimists, though, see it differently, and consider the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity as reflecting a change in Pakistan's regional policy discourse.

The role of China in the establishment of a bilateral crisis management mechanism between the two countries cannot be ignored. China, in a rare diplomatic move, has developed the trilateral forum with both countries, with the obvious purpose of de-escalating tensions between the two countries for the sake of regional stability, necessary for the success of its BRI and CPEC initiatives. Can China facilitate a similar channel between India and Pakistan?

It may be beyond the diplomatic capacity of China to facilitate such an initiative; somehow, CPEC is doing this job. Pakistan's security and political leaderships have already offered India the opportunity to join CPEC. Janjua had also highlighted that the potential of CPEC could not be fully exploited without better trade and transit relations with India. Whether or not India responds positively, a debate on CPEC's prospects has already started in that country. India-held Kashmir leader Mehbooba Mufti has already stated that CPEC could make the region a hub of emerging economic opportunities. For Pakistan, connectivity with India through CPEC can also help make progress on contentious issues, including Kashmir.

Pakistan is largely perceived as a security state, and reimagining it as a transit state may see direct clash with this vision. The attitude and responses of the current Indian regime also matters in regional connectivity initiatives. So far, India has responded to Pakistani offers to connect with CPEC and resume bilateral talks with a cold shoulder. Though India's diplomatic efforts to isolate Pakistan globally have not yielded the desired results and have even increased its cost of connecting with Afghanistan and Central Asia so far, it has not shown flexibility in its approach towards Pakistan.

It was an interesting revelation by the former Pakistani NSA, when he described the details of his interaction with his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval. He said that they 'did not try to win arguments against each other' rather, they discussed how to reduce the trust deficit between their two countries. They agreed that they cannot win a war against each other, and it was better to realise this and act now before the next generation took over and held them responsible for their failures. However, this frank discussion has not resulted in a resumption of the peace process.

The BRI and CPEC initiatives have injected a new spirit in the ideas of regional connectivity, but the older connectivity initiatives cannot be ignored, especially the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. The same factors that had made Saarc non-functional can hinder the way of new ideas of economic integration and connectivity of the region. For India, this is an issue of strategic, geo-economic and diplomatic calculus, but for Pakistan, it is one of consolidating its physical and non-physical resources.


 
 

US warns against IMF bailout for Pakistan that helps  China

US Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo has warned the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the Trump administration will not allow it to lend US dollars to Pakistan for repaying China.

In an interview to CNBC television, broadcast on Monday evening, Secretary Pompeo also expressed the desire to engage with the new Pakistani leadership in a mutually beneficial relationship.

The Financial Times reported earlier this week that Pakistan may seek an IMF bailout package of up to $12 billion to strengthen its fragile economy.

Secretary of state Pompeo expresses desire to engage with new Pakistani leadership in mutually beneficial relationship

Interviewer Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, however, depicted Pakistan's possible request as borrowing money from the IMF to repay China, reminding Sec­retary Pompeo that IMF loans also include US taxpayer dollars.

'There's a chance that US taxpayer dollars are going to go towards Chinese-directed companies as part of that bailout. Are you concerned about that? Are you monitoring that?' she asked.

'So, two thoughts. First, there's new leadership in Pakistan, and we welcome engagement with them in a way that we think will benefit each of our two countries,' Secretary Pompeo replied.

'Second, make no mistake: we will be watching what the IMF does. There's no rationale for IMF tax dollars and associated with that, American dollars that are part of the IMF funding for those to go to bail out Chinese bondholders or China itself,' he said.

The media interpreted this as a message to Pakistan, indicating that Washington will oppose its request for a bailout package from the IMF.

The question about Pakistan, however, was sandwiched bet­ween a barrage of questions on US-China tensions and Wash­ington's response to Beijing's 'One Belt, One Road' initiative, which includes the $62 billion CPEC package for rebuilding Pakistan's decaying infrastructure and reviving its economy.

Asked for comments on Secretary Pompeo's statement, Pakistani officials told journalists in Islamabad that they saw it as an effort to 'use the country's impending economic crisis to drive a wedge between Islamabad and Beijing'.

One senior Pakistani government adviser told the Financial Times: 'The US is trying to spoil China's biggest contribution to our future.'

Another added: 'The Americans are trying very hard to put pressure on Pakistan because they have their own interests. But making it so hard for Pakistan to successfully negotiate a new programme with the IMF makes no sense. Ultimately, Pakistan will search for other options if the road to the IMF is blocked.'

The reported $12bn package would be Pakistan's largest bailout from the IMF.

The FT report from Islamabad said that senior Pakistani officials would present the option to Imran Khan soon after he takes office.

The proposed package double the $5.3bn the fund lent to the country in 2013 would be Pakistan's 13th IMF bailout.

An IMF spokesperson told journalists in Washington on Tuesday that so far, the fund had not received a request from Pakistan and there have been no internal discussion on the proposed package in the IMF.


 
 

Pakistan needs infusion of $12bn in loans immediately: Asad

Faced with an acute financial crisis left behind by the previous government, Pak­istan's incoming finance mini­s­ter estimates the economy may need more than $12 billion infusion of loans within six weeks.

The minister designate Asad Umar, a former head of Pakistani conglomerate Engro Corporation said the nation's financing gap is somewhere between $10bn to $12bn, though the new government would need a bit extra so it doesn't 'live on the edge,' he said in an interview with Bloomberg news.

He also promised to make all Chinese agreements public after criticism of Beijing's opaque Belt and Road loan terms.

'The decision needs to be taken in the next six weeks, the further you go forward the more difficult, the more expensive the options become,' Umar, 56, said in Islamabad.

Pakistan could turn to the International Monetary Fund, friendly countries and issue Diaspora bonds to bolster the nation's depleting reserves, he said.

Pakistan's deteriorating financial situation is a key challenge for new leader Imran Khan, the ex-cricket captain who is attempting to form a coalition government after winning the most seats in last week's election. Many investors and analysts see a bailout from China or the IMF as inevitable.

Foreign-exchange reserves have slumped this year on the back of a widening current-account deficit, prompting the central bank to devalue the currency four times since December and hike interest rates. Moody's Investors Service downgraded the nation's outlook to negative last month, citing the nation's worsening finances.

Mr Umar said Tehreek-i-Insaf hasn't yet spoken to any potential lenders. 'No formal work can be started until the government is formed,' he said.

If Pakistan asks the IMF for support, it won't be the first time. The nation has gone through decades of debt blowouts and balance-of-payment imbalances and 12 IMF programmes since the late 1980s.

The amount of Chinese loans given to Pakistan over the last 13 months alone comes close to the IMF's last bailout of $6.6bn. Those vast debts from Beijing have prompted worries from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said this week he would be watching to see if Khan's new government uses IMF funds to pay off the opaque Chinese loans. Umar said he would bring more transparency to the more than $60bn Belt and Road infrastructure projects in Pakistan and hit back at Pompeo's comments.

'One friendly advice to the Americans, we'll worry about our Chinese debt, but I think they better handle their own Chinese debt first,' he said.

'We have a serious external debt problem, I'm not saying we don't,' though 'we don't have a Chinese debt problem.'

With Pakistan's finances under stress, Khan may struggle to implement his plans to create an 'Islamic welfare state.'

The 65-year-old leader has been coy about how he will fund his expansionist plans, though he said in an interview last month that loans would be needed in the short term.

Reiterating comments made by his leader Imran Khan to Bloomberg in July, Umar said his party won't attempt to privatise Pakistan's bloated and loss-making state companies such as Pakistan International Airlines and Pakistan Steel Mills.

Umar said within the first 100 days of the new administration the state-owned firms will be shifted into a wealth fund similar to Singapore's Temasek Holdings Pvt Ltd to remove them from political interference. The government will also have to take over some, if not all, of the national airline's Rs367bn debt ($2.1bn) to start the carrier's turnaround, he said.

IN the late 1970s, China's leader, Deng Xiaoping, remarked that 'development is the only truth. If we do not develop, we will be bullied'. Today, China cannot be bullied.

Not so, Pakistan.

The popular mandate received by the PTI on July 25 reflects, above all, the desire of the majority of the Pakistani people for national self-respect and an end to the corruption and crony capitalism which has stunted the country's growth, bankrupted its treasury and enlarged inequality and poverty. The new government's primary obligation is to deliver on development.

The development challenge is all the more formidable because, apart from the anticipated obstruction from the 'ancien regime', the incoming PTI government confronts a hostile external environment.

There is an emerging consensus that to halt the haemorrhage of its foreign exchange reserves and stabilise the economy, Pakistan will be obliged to approach the IMF for another bailout. Unfortunately, this may not be easy to achieve.

Pakistan-China ties must be developed on the basis of convergent strategic objectives.

In a blog, Mark Sobel, a former US representative to the IMF, has advocated tough conditions for a staggered IMF programme for Pakistan: further rupee depreciation, higher interest rates, larger tax revenues and structural reforms (higher energy prices, agricultural taxation, privatisation of state-owned corporations, and reduced defence spending). Notably, the PTI's platform incorporates several of these belt-tightening measures.

Read: IMF and CPEC debts

However, Sobel added that the Fund 'should ensure that its resources are not used to bail out unsustainable Chinese CPEC lending. The Fund needs to have at its fingertips comprehensive data on all CPEC lending its terms, maturities and parties involved'.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has jumped on this demand. In a NBC interview, Pompeo said: 'There is no rationale for IMF tax dollars and American dollars to bail out Chinese bond holders and China itself'.

The malice reflected in this assertion was thrown into bold relief by the clarification from Pakistan's last finance minister that the average interest on CPEC loans is three per cent; most loans have five-year grace periods and that repayment of loans and profits to China in the next five years will be less than a billion dollars (a small fraction of the scheduled debt service to the West).

A demand that Pakistan restructure (only) the Chinese loans, or that the IMF monitor and control the terms and progress of CPEC projects, will be obviously unacceptable to both Pakistan and China. Pakistan may have to do without an IMF package.

The purpose of US 'bullying' is no longer simply to secure Pakistan's cooperation on Afghanistan.

The Trump administration has now basically accepted the position, long advocated by Pakistan (and Imran Khan), that the conflict in Afghanistan can be ended only through direct negotiations between the US and the Afghan Taliban. Pakistani officials have claimed that they facilitated the reported direct US-Taliban talks in Doha recently. The US has so far refused to officially acknowledge these talks, much less Pakistan's facilitation. On the contrary, US statements continue to blame Pakistan for the Taliban's ascendant insurgency.

The US may continue to demand Pakistan's help if its talks with the Taliban run into difficulties. But now that it has opened a direct channel with them, the US may well seek to circumvent Pakistan. According to US reports, the US and the Taliban are both flexible on a power-sharing formula and the Taliban are willing to consider the continued presence of some US troops in Afghanistan.

The US objectives in this region now are: the strategic containment of China and Russia, an India-dominated South Asia and the reversal of Iranian power.

Pompeo's position on the IMF package reflects a US attempt to exploit Pakistan's financial vulnerability to retard the execution of CPEC and damage China's broader Belt and Road Initiative objectives.

Editorial: US arrogance

Pakistan may have no option but to rely on China's financial support to stabilise the economy. China has been generous so far in extending balance-of-payments support to Pakistan and it is likely to be helpful in future also. China can also be a major source of foreign investment in Pakistan.

To counter US and Indian machinations, CPEC's execution should be accelerated and its scope further expanded to reflect the PTI's priorities of job creation, social and human development, and agricultural and industrial growth. As part of the envisaged Special Economic Zones, a well-considered plan can be developed to relocate non-competitive manufacturing from China to Pakistan (instead of other Asian countries). The original vision of Gwadar as a major petrochemical processing and trans-shipment centre should be realised.

The strategic dimension of the Pakistan-China relationship has gained greater salience in view of the American decision to compete with and contain China globally and comprehensively. The US clearly regards Pakistan as China's partner and is now treating it as an adversary. The US is arming India to contain China, knowing full well the adverse impact on Pakistan's security. It seeks to neutralise Pakistan's nuclear capabilities. It endorses India's brutal oppression in India-held Kashmir.

India's threats and pressure against Pakistan, especially allegations of 'terrorism' in IHK, are likely to intensify as Modi's BJP mobilises its Hindu constituency to secure re-election in 2019. If Pakistan capitulates to Indian domination, New Delhi's US-supplied military capabilities will be fully deployed against China rather than Pakistan.

The Pakistan-China relationship must be developed, therefore, on the basis of its convergent strategic objectives, not become enmeshed in 'market principles'. Apart from assuring that Pakistan remains solvent and possesses the means for credible defence, China's vocal opposition to Indian threats and US pressure against Pakistan would go a long way towards ensuring peace, stability and development in South Asia.

It would be appropriate for the new prime minister to visit China immediately after assuming office to lay the foundation of a new and stronger strategic partnership.

Of course, China's support must be accompanied by a national campaign to mobilise the resources required to promote the promised 'Islamic welfare state'.

It is only once Pakistan is less vulnerable, economically and militarily that it will be able to resist US bullying and build a relationship of mutual respect and mutual benefit with America.

Militancy fears

A SPATE of terror attacks in the Diamer district of Gilgit-Baltistan is worrying and mystifying. A sudden eruption of violence over the weekend, with arson attacks on a number of schools in the Diamer region, and helter-skelter attempts by the security apparatus to find the culprits, took another turn on Sunday. Militants on higher ground attacked security personnel and government officials travelling by road below, effectively cutting off two tehsils of Diamer district and narrowly failing in an assassination attempt on a district and sessions judge. The sudden eruption of violence in a region that has been relatively calm in recent times has brought quick explanations from security officials. One is that anti-Pakistan militants in Afghanistan are the architects of the attacks.

 But security officials in Kohistan, the KP district which shares a boundary with Diamer in GB, have claimed that neither is there an organised presence of militants in Kohistan nor has unusual cross-boundary movement been detected between the latter and Diamer. The second theory, then, is that elements hostile to CPEC and China's Belt and Road Initiative may be trying to spread unrest in a region that is a choke point for a transformative regional economic programme.

A thorough investigation and transparent sharing of the facts with the public alone can establish the immediate reasons for the upsurge of violence in GB. It is possible that anti-Pakistan militants based in Afghanistan have played a role in organising the attacks, and it is also possible that elements hostile to CPEC and BRI are involved. Inevitably, however, all externally directed attacks require a local infrastructure. If militants based in Afghanistan are responsible for the violence in GB, they can only carry out attacks if facilitated by a network inside Pakistan. Similarly, if external elements trying to destabilise a region critical to the success of CPEC and BRI are involved, they surely cannot conduct attacks without creating local networks. Necessary as it is to expose the so-called foreign hand that is frequently alleged to have its fingerprints all over acts of terrorism inside Pakistan, the long internal fight against militancy and violent extremism will not be won until local networks are identified, found and permanently deactivated. Indeed, the eagerness to point fingers externally often obscures local and domestic failures.

Perhaps most telling is that it was schools, a number of them all-girl institutes, that the militants attacked. There remains a violent extremism embedded in communities across Pakistan that needs to be forthrightly addressed. The incoming provincial and federal governments will have a relatively poor track record of fighting extremism to build on. The National Action Plan exists, but it needs to be reinvigorated and expanded. The price of further inaction could be the Diamer violence replicated in other parts of the country.

Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing on Monday lauded Pakistan's role in the promotion of peace and prosperity in the region and said it is a key partner in the One Belt One Road Project.

Speaking at a discussion on regional cooperation organised by the Institute of Regional Studies at the Institute of Strategic Studies, the Chinese envoy said China wanted to end the recent trade and tariff issue with America.

He added that the Chinese economy made remarkable progress during 2015-16 and that the One Belt One Road Project was initiated to integrate the whole region.

'China believes in the integration of the region,' he added, and that Pakistan has played an important role in this regard.

Mr Jing said Pakistan has played an important role in ECO, SCO and Saarc and added that Pakistan and China will play an important role in regional cooperation.

He added that Pakistan and India are both important neighbours for China which wants to promote trade with its neighbours.

Caretaker Information Minister Barrister Ali Zafar said Pakistan is a victim of terrorism and that all countries were responsible for contributing towards the eradication of terrorism. He also deplored the brutalities of the Indian army in Indian-held Kashmir.

'We want to improve regional cooperation involving China, Russia and other nations,' he said.

Former Senator Farhatullah Babar regional integration is not possible as long as regional trade is sacrificed for so-called security.

Mr Babar said Pakistan needs to follow the Chinese model whose trade with India had crossed over $100 billion despite serious political issues between them.

'Some elements also fear that if there is peace in the region, it will challenge their predominance in the business of the state,' he said.

Fitch warns of CPEC 'curtailment' under IMF programme

The US pressure could lead to 'stricter' conditions by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to bailout Pakistan, including curtailment of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and greater transparency in its financing, according to Fitch Rating.

The 'US pressure could lead to stricter programme conditionality, including the curtailment of CPEC projects and greater transparency in CPEC financing', said the New York-based rating agency. It said US backing was not strictly required to secure an IMF programme, but the IMF board emphasised consensus decision-making.

It said Pakistan's incoming PTI-led coalition government will be under immediate pressure to arrest the deterioration in external finances and address fiscal challenges, as well as to attract the external funding necessary to meet its financing gap.

'The new government has more political capital to take positive though difficult policy actions, but it has a thin majority in parliament and faces a strong opposition, which could complicate policymaking,' Fitch said.

The rating agency expects Pakistan to seek potential financing from several sources including China and multilateral development banks, and possibly the IMF. Pakistan has been a repeated user of IMF financing, entering 12 programmes since 1980.

The IMF would probably require further fiscal and monetary tightening, greater exchange-rate flexibility, and wide-ranging structural reforms, which could also help attract other sources of financing.

Moreover, the IMF has unique monitoring mechanisms to implement corrective policies, without which there will continue to be significant uncertainty over the medium-term sustainability of Pakistan's finances.

Negotiations over an IMF agreement could be complicated by loans linked to the CPEC, part of China's Belt Road Initiative (BRI), particularly amid rising global geopolitical tensions. Recent statements from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggest the US administration does not want IMF financing used to bail out Chinese lenders.

The $62bn CPEC project makes Pakistan one of the largest recipients of BRI financing. These loans have financed imports of capital goods, which have in turn inflated the current account deficit. The loans will eventually need to be repaid or refinanced.

The rating agency said PTI founder Imran Khan, outlined a broad economic agenda for a 'New Pakistan' during his campaign, with a focus on confronting corruption, reducing inequality and expanding social services. However, advancement of this policy agenda is likely to be limited in the short term, with external and fiscal problems taking priority.

The current account deficit reached 5.6pc of GDP in the fiscal year ended June 2018, up from 4.7pc in FY17, while liquid foreign-exchange reserves fell by almost $4bn from end-December 2017 to end-July 2018 to just over $10bn.

The sharp rise in global risk aversion towards emerging markets, and a projected pickup in Pakistan's external debt obligations in 2019 are adding to financing pressures. The fiscal deficit has also widened and is likely to well exceed previous estimate of 6pc of GDP in FY18, up from 5.8pc a year earlier.

Fitch revised the outlook on Pakistan's 'B' rating to 'negative' from 'stable' in January to reflect these rising external and fiscal pressures.

The State Bank of Pakistan has already taken some steps, raising its policy rate by 175bps since January and introducing greater flexibility in the heavily managed rupee by allowing four separate depreciations since mid-December 2017, which resulted in a cumulative 17pc decline against the dollar.

These measures have so far not been enough to prevent the widening of the large external financing gap, which has been bridged with support from China, including an agreement to provide $2bn in additional bilateral lending in July. The Saudi-backed Islamic Development Bank has also reportedly extended a $4bn loan, the rating agency claimed.

The new government appeared to recognise the urgency of the situation, with the likely incoming finance minister, Asad Umar, stating that 'all options are on the table' and that the government will formulate a policy and financing path within six weeks.


 
 

Trump in the  China  shop

A RECENT Financial Times editorial described President Donald Trump's concept of foreign policy as 'a series of parallel exercises in strong-armed dealmaking with other leaders sometimes with no clear end game in mind'. This assessment is extremely charitable.

US strong-armed tactics now cover a very wide canvas: pressure on Mexico and Canada to revise the Nafta; on G7 and EU allies to lower tariffs; on Nato allies to pay more; on Turkey to release an evangelical pastor; on Pakistan to 'do more' in Afghanistan; on the Palestinians to accept a blatantly one-sided solution with Israel; on North Korea to unilaterally denuclearise; on Iran to disavow its nuclear and missile programmes and reverse its regional ambitions; on Russia to withdraw from Crimea and end its role in the Ukraine; and, most importantly, on China to retard its rapid economic, military and technological progress.

These policies will 'break a lot of china' not only in the targeted countries but also in America. None of these exercises in coercion is likely to end well.

Nafta will be revised; but not much will be gained materially by the US, while trust will be lost with its North American neighbours.

Nato allies will agree to pay more for their defence; but their confidence in their US protector has been significantly eroded. Many Europeans are now seeking closer economic and political relations with Moscow and Beijing.

None of America's exercises in coercion is likely to end well.

The sanctions against Turkey threaten the integrity of the Nato alliance; the spat will further destabilise Syria and Iraq; and the lira's fall may trigger an emerging markets' financial crisis.

After relocating its embassy to Jerusalem, the US can no longer play the mediator's role in the Middle East. The much-heralded Trump plan for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement is likely to be shelved.

The unilateral anti-Iran sanctions will strengthen the hardliners in Tehran; may lead to resumption of Iranian nuclear enrichment; intensify its interventions in Syria, Iraq and Yemen and embolden Israel to instigate a conflict with Iran, which could draw in the US and others.

Pressure on Pakistan is unlikely to advance the prospects of a political solution in Afghanistan. Unless ground realities are acknowledged, and peace negotiated with an ascendant Taliban insurgency, the end of the US adventure in Afghanistan could come in the shape of a tweeted abandonment.

After Trump's impetuously accepted Singapore summit with North Korea, Pyongyang is in a stronger position to resist unilateral denuclearisation.

Despite escalating US sanctions, Russia will not withdraw from Crimea nor back off in Ukraine. It is building its economic and political relations with several European countries. The Russia-China strategic partnership now controls the Eurasian 'heartland'.

Trump's most fateful decision is to confront China. The Sino-US trade war will reduce growth in both economies. Chinese exports of manufactures and US exports of food, oil and gas and services will decline. Manufacturing jobs will not return to the US; some may be transferred from China to other low-cost countries. Combined with the increasing dollar interest rates, financial outflows from emerging markets and reduced cross-border investments, US-China tensions could trigger another global recession.

The increasingly vocal US opposition to China's Belt and Road Initiative, and its first component, CPEC, is a myopic posture that will be seen as an attempt to deny the prospects for development for Eurasia's developing economies. It may turn out to be a lost opportunity for the US (and India) to participate in and benefit from the broad regional and global cooperation envisaged under the BRI.

Following on Obama's 'pivot to Asia', America's naval assets are now deployed mostly in the recently renamed 'Indo-Pacific' and are conducting aggressive 'freedom of navigation' manoeuvres in the South China Sea. The objective is unclear. China obviously does not want a military confrontation with the US. But any attempt to block China's shipping, occupy the islands it claims or instigate Taiwanese 'independence', will provoke a war as the Chinese have warned.

Is the US navy ready to 'fight tonight', as the last commander of the US Pacific Fleet asserted? Will the Quad the US-sponsored military alliance between the US, Japan, Australia, and India prove credible? China is the largest trading partner of each of the Quad's members. Likewise, the prosperity of most Asean countries is linked to China's growth. They are anxious to prevent Sino-US tensions.

The US strategy in Asia counts heavily on building India as a strategic counterweight to China, signified by the nomenclature change of the US Command from the 'Pacific' to 'Indo-Pacific'. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was quick to rush into the American embrace. But Modi's address at the Singapore security forum last April indicates that New Delhi may have second thoughts about an alliance with America.

The Doklam 'stand-off' demonstrated that India is not well placed to confront China militarily. The perils of confrontation and the benefits of cooperation were crystallised at the two Xi-Modi summits. China is India's largest trading partner. Cooperation with China can 'moderate' India's 'problems' with Pakistan. On the other hand, India's differences with the US, especially on trade and immigration, have become increasingly evident.

India will accept US largesse (technology, investment, armed Predator drones, etc); but it is unlikely to buy its major weapons systems or its nuclear power reactors from the US due to considerations of price, reliability and its relationship with Russia, its traditional arms supplier, which, if spurned, could open the arms spigot for Pakistan. Certainly, India will not be ready to 'fight tonight' for America against China.

America's multifaceted belligerence and bullying cannot be ascribed entirely to Trump's mercurial and narcissistic personality. Current US foreign policy reflects the sum of the maximalist aspirations of the US 'establishment', right-wing politicians and ideologues, anti- Muslim groups and the powerful Israeli lobby. The hubris reflected in these policies may have been understandable during America's 'unipolar moment' after the Soviet Union's collapse. But today, in a manifestly multipolar world, the endeavour to strong-arm so many nations simultaneously is surely strategic overreach and monumental folly.

Dean's reception for ambassadors

Dean of the diplomatic corps, Turkmenitan's Ambassador Atajan Movlamov, held a lunch reception the day before the Eid holidays to bid farewell to two envoys and welcome two new ones. Norwegian Ambassador Tore Nedrebø and Sri Lanka's High Commissioner Jayanath Lokuketagodage were both leaving after about three-year postings to Pakistan.

In their speeches, both envoys expressed gratefulness to fellow diplomats and the Pakistan authorities for a great time in the country.

Retired Gen Lokuketagodage said he would cherish his memories from Pakistan till the time of his death. 'But before that, I hope to visit Pakistan many times', he said. Mr. Nedrebø used more prosaic words as he emphasized the increased commercial cooperation between his country and Pakistan.

The dean also welcomed the recently arrived Greek Ambassador Dimitris Hatzopoulos and the Ambassador of Lebanon Ghassan El Khatob, who arrived in spring. There had not been any event for all the envoys and heads of UN organizations to introduce the Lebanese ambassador sooner, explained Mr. Movlamov.

He said he appreciated that so many envoys and acting envoys had found the opportunity to attend the event in spite of it being holiday season and also just before Eidul Azha.

A diplomat from Jordan said that in his country, Eid had started one day earlier than in Pakistan, and that he found it pleasant to begin the religious feast by meeting fellow diplomats. He and other diplomats seemed to be of the same opinion and stayed long during the buffet lunch.

The outgoing envoys left with good memories and a carved chest of drawers with the names of all the fellow envoys in the inlaid brass cover.

'I now have to find all my jewellery to fill the chest', mused Anne Dessingtin, wife of the Norwegian ambassador, holding a bouquet of farewell flowers.

Chinese envoy speaks at photo exhibition

Chinese ambassador Yao Jing, former interim information minister Barrister Syed Ali Zafar and PNCA Director General Jamal Shah at the opening of a photo and art exhibition in Islamabad.

At the opening of a photo exhibition titled Mera Pakistan at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) in Islamabad recently, Chinese ambassador Yao Jing spoke about culture and people-to-people cooperation between China and Pakistan.

He also took time to express his appreciation of the strong diplomatic relations, and he emphasized the importance of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Belt and Road Initiative, notably the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.

Ambassador Yao Jing said that nine CPEC projects have already been completed, 13 are in progress, and 15 energy projects are in planning, which will increase the electricity output by about 11,000 megawatt, and over 7,000 megawatt are already about to be produced.

The event was attended by Syed Ali Zafar, former interim minister of information, broadcasting, national history and literary history, and PNCA Director General Syed Jamal Shah PNCA has a sizeable exhibition on Chinese art and it houses a Chinese Cultural Centre at a separate section above the large auditorium.

'It is frequently used for various events, such as two recent lectures on the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine', explained a cultural attaché.

'I am glad that the Sino-Pak cooperation increasingly includes art, culture, language and philosophy. Roads and electricity are important, but not all', said a Pakistani guest who is a frequent participant at such events.

ALTHOUGH Pakistan is the largest partner in the One Belt, One Road project, getting a Chinese visa for even taxpayers such as myself is a headache.

The list of documents required is not only long, it touches absurdity. For instance, every application requires a signed police character certificate and an invitation letter from China signed and stamped by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Chinese make no distinction between taxpayers and non-taxpayers.

Over $60 billion worth of projects, most of which will benefit China, are being built by Chinese firms in Pakistan. Most of these firms bring in all resources from China. The country exports $12bn worth of goods to Pakistan and the Free Trade Agreement is in place for around 5,500 items.

On the other hand, Pakistan exports only $1.2bn goods' worth to China.

I ask my Chinese friends, for what use has Pakistan been working with you when even a visa, which you give freely without any invitations to most Asian states, is a problem for mid-level businesses such as mine?

I request our CPEC negotiators to make all previous deals with China transparent, to not provide free access to China and its people, and place similar restrictions on Chinese visa applicants.

They should know it's the Naya Pakistan.


 
 

Pakistan,  China  agree to broaden CPEC base

Pakistan and China on Sunday agreed to formally invite 'third-country' investors to be part of the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and add social sector and regional development schemes to the existing portfolio of CPEC projects.

The understanding on addition of 'two major dimensions' to the CPEC projects came about at a long meeting between the Planning, Development and Reforms Commission of Pakistan and the National Development and Reforms Commission (NDRC) of China on Sunday.

At the four-hour meeting, the Pakistani team was led by Minister for Planning Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar while the NDRC's vice-chairman, Ning Jizhe, led the Chinese delegation. Planning Secretary Zafar Hassan, CPEC's project director Hassan Daud and officials of the NDRC and Chinese Embassy also attended the meeting.

Sources said that Beijing wanted involvement in the upcoming special economic zones (SEZs) of countries friendly to both Pakistan and China because it wished to steer clear of adverse criticism, particularly from the US and India, about possibility of secretive deals that 'remain beyond public eye'.

No country was specifically mentioned in this regard and Central Asian, European and other countries including Turkey, Russia and Saudi Arabia could invest in the nine SEZs proposed, said an official.

Gwadar to be 're-prioritised' as hub of heavy industry

Gwadar would be re-prioritised as a centre of industries for export markets where these countries could invest alone or in partnership with Pakistan or China, to take advantage of the city's trans-shipment potential and location apart from the free-zone incentives it offered.

The government led by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) wished to include in the project portfolio social sector schemes involving clean drinking water, health, education and technical training to bring the huge initiative in line with Prime Minister Imran Khan's priority areas of human development. This could be done by making some changes in the seven central pillars of the CPEC's Long Term Plan.

The official, however, agreed that China and Pakistan had so far not been able to settle key issues about development of the Rashakai or Hattar SEZ in the first phase of industrial cooperation. Thus, it would be difficult to attract 'third-country' investors immediately.

He insisted that the two sides would work from now on to achieve the big objective and recalled that even the basic issues of CPEC were not settled in the first meeting.

Mr Bakhtiar, he said, had already ordered the relevant agencies to take the various SEZ projects to the groundbreaking stage within three months as a lot of time had already been wasted.

'Realigning the goals of CPEC, Pakistan has introduced new targets of socioeconomic and regional development under this unprecedented mega project,' said the Planning Commission in an official statement.

The minister reaffirmed his government's commitment to the CPEC and 'categorically said that all-out efforts would be made for the success of this project of economic development and prosperity. CPEC is a reality... aimed at initiating a modern era of trade and economic growth', said the statement.

To achieve the new targets, the government was dedicated to putting all its energies together to make progress at the earliest, said the official.

During the meeting, both the sides said that CPEC 'an icon of the Belt and Road Initiative' was an engine of rapid growth for Pakistan and a manifestation of the strong Pak-China relations that would continue to promote inclusiveness.

The Pakistani team also told the visiting dignitaries that the PTI-led government accorded top priority to the development of Gwadar as a standalone project. The port city would be transformed into a trans-shipment hub and a centre for industrialisation with special focus on industrial units enjoying incentives that could produce a high rate of return.

The two sides agreed that industrial cooperation should be the main area of attention so that efforts were made to encourage relocation of Chinese industries with a view to increasing exports and maximising employment opportunities.

The Pakistani side said that progress had now been expedited and investors from across the world were being encouraged to populate the SEZs.

Mr Bakhtyar said his government intended to encourage projects based on indigenous sources of energy, including Thar Coal.

On the occasion, Mr Ning praised the PTI-led government's agenda and its efforts for socioeconomic development of the country. He reiterated the commitment that Chinese companies would effectively work for completion of the CPEC projects.

The two sides also decided to further expedite key development projects in Gwadar and ensure groundbreaking this year of the New Gwadar International Airport, a technical institute and a hospital there.



 

Afghan connection

SHAH Mehmood Qureshi had a busy week. The trip by the US secretary of state was followed by a visit by the Chinese foreign minister. One theme ran through both meetings: Afghanistan. The US is pushing Pakis­tan to cut its alleged support for the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani Network; China is urging Pakistan to facilitate the Afghanistan peace process. So far, so familiar.

But there is a related dynamic that Pakistanis pay less heed to, and that's the evolving China-Afghanistan relationship. A reminder of this came last week with news that China would train Afghan troops. That budding bilateral relationship presents both opportunities and challenges for the Sino-Pak relationship.

China will reportedly train Afghan troops for deployment in the Wakhan Corridor, which links the Afghan province of Badakshan with western China. It is also considering Afghanistan's request for combat aircraft. These are the latest developments in a growing military relationship: Beijing has granted $70 million in military aid to Kabul over the past three years. China has also held meetings with Afghan Taliban representatives over the past year, and was rumoured (alongside Pakistan) to have brokered and guaranteed the Eidul Fitr ceasefire.

Islamabad has an opportunity to equalise its ties with Beijing.

These developments should remind Pakistan that China only does what it does to serve its own interests. In this case, Beijing has three reasons to pursue closer involvement in Afghanistan.

The most important, in Beijing's perspective, is to check Uighur radicalisation. China fears that oppressed Uighurs will increasingly depart for Afghanistan to receive militant training, and that fighters affiliated with both the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and the militant Islamic State group will increasingly access western China via the Wakhan Corridor to carry out attacks.

The main goal of Chinese investment in a 'mountain brigade' in the Wakhan Corridor is to block this two-way flow. This also explains why the majority of Chinese development spending in Afghanistan $90m worth in September 2017 alone is concentrated in Badakshan, the proximate Afghan province.

Media reports suggest that part of China's efforts to engage with the Afghan Taliban is to dispel the perception that the Chinese are anti-Muslim (apparently Taliban representatives were offered tours of a Chinese mosque). These interactions are aimed at staving off Beijing's nightmare scenario of the Afghan Taliban formally joining forces with ETIM.

China's second, related goal is to ensure the security of its Belt and Road Initiative. Beijing has recognised that an Afghanistan offering sanctuary to various militant groups poses the greatest threats to its flagship CPEC projects, and seeks to stabilise the country before the corridor is fully 'online'.

Finally, growing Chinese influence in Afghanistan will help loosen the historic US grip over Kabul, something Beijing will in­­creasingly seek as Sino-US tensions intensify.

These drivers present Islamabad with an opportunity to equalise its relationship with Beijing. After all, China does not know Afghanistan the way Pakistan does. It requires Pakistani interlocutors to achieve its goals. And in exchange for facilitation, China will be the heavy hitter ensuring Pakistan's seat on the table during any peace negotiations.

Knowing this, China is already playing an important role in brokering Af-Pak ties. It has urged the new government to establish a crisis prevention mechanism to prevent hostilities from escalating after incidents such as terror attacks within Afghanistan. Last December, it hosted trilateral talks where Kabul, Beijing and Islam­abad jointly called on the Afghan Taliban to engage in peace talks.

But China's growing involvement in Afghanistan may also create tensions in the Sino-Pak relationship. Here's the thing: China's main goal in Afghanistan is ostensibly to keep ETIM out, while Pakistan's is to keep India out. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's counterproductive visit last week is a good reminder of how alliances end up when supposed allies have divergent strategic objectives.

China will use all the resources at its disposal to achieve its ends in Afghanistan. And this includes India. Just this April, Xi Jingping and Narendra Modi agreed to cooperate in Afghanistan, including by launching joint economic projects to spur growth and stability. At some point, China may ask Pakistan to curb what some allege is its tolerance of militants in Afghanistan.

So far, Islamabad has not appeared averse to Chinese intervention in its security policies. But as Washington will tell Beijing, there is a point at which Pakistan will not budge from prioritising its security and strategic objectives, no matter how high or sweet the friendship. It remains to be seen whether Afghanistan will be the forge that further melds the allies, or the anvil on which the relationship faces blows.


 
 

Islamabad, Beijing reaffirm commitment to CPEC

Pakistan and China on Monday reaffirmed their commitment to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and resolved to extend the multi-billion dollar joint undertaking of the two countries.

This commitment was reflected in the statements issued from Islamabad and Beijing after a claim attributed to Prime Minister Imran Khan's adviser on commerce, textiles, industries and investment Abdul Razzak Dawood left the government red-faced and equally embarrassed the Chinese.

The Financial Times, quoting government ministers and advisers, reported that the Pakistan government was planning 'to review or renegotiate agreements reached under China's Belt and Road Initiative'. The publication quoted Mr Dawood as having said: 'The previous government did a bad job negotiating with China on CPEC - they didn't do their homework correctly and didn't negotiate correctly so they gave away a lot.'

The adviser went on to say: 'Chinese companies received tax breaks, many breaks and have an undue advantage in Pakistan; this is one of the things we're looking at because it's not fair that Pakistan companies should be disadvantaged.'

Adviser and Chinese embassy reject Financial Times story which quotes Dawood as saying govt plans to review Belt and Road Initiative accords

He said that a newly established CPEC committee would 'think through CPEC - all of the benefits and the liabilities'.

This controversy erupted soon after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi concluded his three-day trip to Pakistan after engaging with the newly-inducted Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government during which the Imran Khan administration vowed to keep the CPEC a top priority.

The Foreign Office in a statement said: 'Pakistani leadership conveyed that CPEC was a national priority for the Government. Pakistan remains committed to the successful implementation of CPEC. There was complete consensus on the future trajectory of CPEC between Pakistan and China.'

The FO said there was agreement on expanding the CPEC to new areas of cooperation, including socio-economic development, poverty alleviation, anti-corruption, agricultural cooperation and industrial development as per the needs and priorities of the country.

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang, in his regular media briefing in Beijing, said that it was decided that the future course of the CPEC was to be decided through negotiations in view of the new government's priorities and the needs of Pakistani people.

'Priorities will be given to speeding up industrial cooperation and livelihood projects, and we will gradually extend them to the western part of Pakistan and enable more Pakistanis to benefit from the CPEC,' he said, adding that the aim of the CPEC was to benefit Pakistani people and deliver tangible benefits to the ordinary Pakistanis.

The Chinese embassy in Islamabad was, meanwhile, more categorical as it rejected the Financial Times report as 'ill intentioned', saying it that was 'based on distorted and misquoted information'.

The embassy said that the report reflected what it called 'total ignorance and neglect of the CPEC or China-Pakistan traditional partnership'.

The embassy recalled the firm consensus between China and Pakistan that the CPEC was a mutually beneficial project and said that both the governments would carry it forward.


 
 

CPEC and the 'Great Game'

OVER the past year, the Western media, echoed by many in India and some in Pakistan, has conducted an extensive campaign of criticism against the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project. It has been variously asserted that the project is building roads that are not needed; it will only facilitate China's trade and bring little benefit to Pakistan; it will burden Pakistan with enormous foreign debt, and so on.

This campaign gained momentum after US Defence Secretary James Mattis remarked that CPEC would traverse 'disputed territory' (meaning Gilgit- Baltistan) and former US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson questioned the financial structure of projects under China's Belt and Road Initiative. US opposition to CPEC seemed to be confirmed when in July the current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued that an IMF financing programme for Pakistan should not be used to repay Chinese 'bond holders' and banks.

The US stance was interpreted widely as part of its strategic confrontation with China (spanning trade, technology, the South China Sea) and an additional point of pressure to secure Pakistan's compliance with American demands on Afghanistan.

The US has several tactical and strategic reasons to cooperate with China and support CPEC.

The state secretary's remarks redoubled the doubts within the incoming Pakistani government about the wisdom of approaching the IMF to achieve the urgently required stabilisation of Pakistan's economy, especially its external imbalances. In an interview, Finance Minister Asad Umar stated that 'if we choose not to go to the IMF', it will not be because of the expected 'economic pain' but because of 'non-economic' and 'national security' considerations.

Prior to the elections, PTI leaders had spoken of the need to review some of the CPEC projects and to prioritise the social objectives espoused by the party. China was naturally anxious that between this desire for a review by the new government and the Western media onslaught, the CPEC project, which is the flagship of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, may be derailed.

CPEC was a major item on Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's agenda for his recent visit and talks with the new Pakistani government. Any doubts regarding Pakistan's position on CPEC were laid to rest in the public and private assurances conveyed by the prime minister, foreign minister and the COAS to the Chinese foreign minister.

But the Western media has persisted in its campaign. The Financial Times published an article entitled 'Pakistan rethinks its role in Xi's Belt and Road plan', printed the day after the Chinese foreign minister's visit. It quoted purported remarks by Pakistan's trade adviser expressing disquiet about the 'disadvantages' of some CPEC agreements which Pakistan intends to 'renegotiate'. The commerce ministry immediately issued a strong rebuttal stating that there was 'complete unanimity' between China and Pakistan on CPEC's future direction and affirmed the Pakistani government's commitment to CPEC.

Even after this, the Wall Street Journal offered an article asserting that Pakistan is 'pressing' China 'to realign the goals' of CPEC 'to take on poverty-alleviating initiatives and build factories'.

In fact, the projects included under CPEC were those identified by the previous PML-N government. China has consistently expressed readiness to reflect the priorities of the new government for social infrastructure and poverty alleviation projects. An agreement to make these and other adjustments was in fact reached a day ago by Pakistan's planning minister and deputy head of China's National Development and Reform Commission.

Meanwhile, Pakistan's information minister told the press that during his talks in Islamabad, the US secretary of state had assured that the US will not block an IMF financing programme for Pakistan. This implies a lifting of US objections to the servicing of Chinese debt (which is a fraction of debt to Western financial sources).

A video, circulating on the internet, evidently sponsored by the Wall Street Journal, projects Pakistan and CPEC as the fulcrum of US-China strategic competition. Yet, the Western media may be 'more royal than the king' if not dead wrong. Rather than being the focus of competition, Pakistan and Afghanistan may be one area where the US and China could cooperate rather than compete.

The US has several tactical and strategic reasons to cooperate with China and support CPEC.

First, the US needs China's support to realise a political settlement in Afghanistan. The US and China are both working in parallel to improve Pakistan-Afghanistan relations. China also has close contacts with the Afghan Taliban. It desires, like the US, to eliminate all terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. It can make large investments in Afghanistan. And it can moderate any disruption of a political settlement by Iran, Pakistan and even Russia.

Second, the extension of CPEC to Afghanistan would contribute to its 'connectivity' to Central Asia, China and beyond, and foster its development and stability. Moreover, if India joins CPEC (eventually), it will gain access to Afghanistan and Central Asia (which Pakistan has staunchly resisted so far). Both objectives are part of the US strategy for South Asia. While noting the new Pakistan government's commitment to CPEC, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman significantly added that the construction of CPEC 'can absorb third party participation and benefit the entire region'.

Third, CPEC is essential for the stabilisation and growth of the Pakistani economy. The US will no doubt pressure Pakistan to do its bidding on Afghanistan. It will push Pakistan to bend, not break. In the ultimate analysis, a 'failed' nuclear Pakistan is not a palatable prospect for either the US or China. China's assumption of the onus for Pakistan's economic stabilisation is not a bad bargain for the US.

These considerations may not be accepted at present by vengeful US generals, intelligence operatives and ideologues, smarting from their failure in Afghanistan. They are better understood by US foreign policy professionals. Indeed, the Obama administration expressed support for CPEC.

The major opposition to CPEC, going forward, will emanate from a chauvinistic Indian regime which sees the sponsorship of terrorism in Balochistan and unrest in Gilgit-Baltistan as a smart strategy to restrain Pakistan's support for the Kashmiri freedom struggle. Yet, given the tectonic shifts in strategic alignments in the entire Asian heartland, and the opportunities for an economy-led normalisation across the region, India may be shooting itself in the foot.


 
 

Papers indicate Afghan issue not sole cause of US-Pakistan discord

Two recent US documents the 2019 budget proposals and the Pentagon's 2018 report to Congress on China indicate that differences between the United States and Pakistan go beyond Afghanistan as Washington feels Islamabad is gradually slipping out of its orbit.

The budget proposals underline China and Russia as 'the central threat to America's prosperity and security' and highlight the strategy to meet this challenge.

The Defence Department's report warns Congress that 'China will seek to establish additional military bases in countries with which it has a long-standing friendly relationship and similar strategic interests, such as Pakistan, and in which there is a precedent for hosting foreign militaries'.

The US media also noticed Washington's growing concern as Wall Street Journal reported this week that 'in Pakistan, China and the US are clashing over China's One Belt, One Road initiative'.

While Washington is concerned that China is trying to gain global influence through 'debt trap diplomacy' by lending countries money for projects they can't afford, 'Beijing calls this Western propaganda,' the report added.

The budget proposals, released in Washington last week, stressed that 'the central challenge to US prosperity and security is the re-emergence of long-term, strategic competition (with) … revisionist powers' China and Russia.

A quote from the US National Security Strategy warns that 'China and Russia want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions'.

The budget proposals then describe how the Trump administration plans to deal with the threat by building 'a more lethal, resilient, and rapidly innovating joint force, combined with a robust constellation of allies and partners'.

This alliance and the new force 'will sustain American influence and ensure favourable balances of power that safeguard the free and open international order', the document adds.

It points out that in alignment with the National Defence Strategy, the air force's budget for 2019 prioritises long-term competition with China and Russia by 'investing in key capabilities to increase the lethality of the force through cost-effective modernisation.

The strategy prioritises major power competition and vows to 'reverse the erosion of US military advantage in relation to China and Russia'.

The document informs Congress that the defence budget request fulfills the Pentagon's objectives by increasing 'lethality; resilience (and) agility' of the defence forces. The objective behind this approach is to 'build a flexible and dynamic force; and work by, with, and through allies and partners'.

The document also informs Congress that the Pentagon has taken specific decisions about the budget that support 'a more capable, ready, and efficient force that can project power globally for full-spectrum operations against a range of threats'.

The document explains the US decision to partner with India to reverse China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

The Pentagon's report to Congress on China argues that Beijing's growing arms exports are geared to promote China's 'broader foreign policy goals', which is particularly evident in its 'arms sales to Pakistan and demand for Chinese armed UAVs'.

From 2012 through 2016, China was the fifth largest arms supplier in the world, completing more than $20 billion in sales. Of these sales, military equipment worth $8 billion went to Indo-Pacific countries, primarily Pakistan.

The Pentagon report claims that China's ability to remain among the world's top five global arms suppliers largely hinges on continued strong sales to Pakistan and demand for its armed UAVs.

In 2015, China signed an agreement with Pakistan for the sale of eight YUAN-class submarines; the first four submarines will be built in China and the remaining four in Pakistan, the report added.

Punjab University's Dean Faculty of Arts and Humanities and director Pakistan Study Centre Prof Dr Iqbal Chawla says the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CEPC) is road to peace and prosperity for the region and both the countries would eliminate all hurdles in this joint project.

He was addressing a seminar organised by the Pakistan Study Centre on China Pakistan Economic Corridor at Al Razi Hall on Monday.

Jiangsu Normal University China's Director of Pakistan Research Centre Prof Dr Sun Hongqi, Dean of the International College Prof Zhang Shengzhe, Deputy Dean of the International College Zhen Yutong, Director of the Social Science Academy Professor Lou Zhengrong, analyst Muhammad Mehdi, Dr Amjad Abbas Magsi, faculty members and a large number of students were present.

Dr Chawla said One Belt One Road (OBOR) was an effort to revive ancient silk route and the CPEC had been brininging China and Pakistan closer with every passing day. He said the international powers were scared of China's emergence as second super power of the world and were creating hurdles in the development of the CPEC and OBOR.

He said the development of infrastructure had mostly taken place and now the time had arrived to help underdeveloped areas of Pakistan.

Prof Sun expressed his views that the OBOR was put forward in 2013 and it had been welcomed by most countries of the world and reached great achievements. He said the size of trade between China and other countries along OBOR had expanded rapidly in the past five years and OBOR would also provide 200,000 jobs for locals.

He said that Jiangsu and Punjab were brother-provinces and should join hands to construct CPEC and OBOR.

He said that Jiangsu Normal University and Punjab University had cooperated for many years and surely would play more positive roles in construction of the CPEC and OBOR.

Prof Zhang Shengzhen reviewed the Pak-China communication and focused on the potential cooperation in the field of education and enterprises. Mr Mehdi also spoke.

Later, the delegation called on PU Vice Chancellor in his office. The delegation offered scholarship to students of the Punjab University and stressed more avenues for cooperation between the two universities.

ONLINE ADMISSIONS: The PU administration has launched online admission system in all its honors/master's level academic programmes from the current academic session for the first time in the history.

PU VC Prof Niaz Ahmad, Admission Committee Chairman Prof Dr Taqi Zahid Butt and other officials reviewed online admission process.

According to a press release, Prof Ahmed said that the initiative was taken to facilitate candidates from all over Pakistan who earlier had to personally visit the varsity for admission thus resulting in wastage of time and money.

Prof Dr Taqi Zahid Butt said that the aspirants could submit forms online till Sept 28. He said a helpline had also been established to guide the candidates. He advised the candidates to visit http://admissions.pu.edu.pk for details.


 
 

'Pakistan must take long-term policy measures'

Pakistan has all the ingredients and the right intent to recover from the current economic problems by investing in long-term policies, says Citi's Managing Director of Europe, Middle East and Africa Grant Carson in an interview to Dawn.

He said that Citi is committed to 'assist Pakistan in helping fix its macroeconomic woes.' Citibank was one of the lead managers in helping Pakistan raise $2.5 billion last year from the global capital markets.

'We are optimistic on Pakistan, it has ample opportunities to seize on right now,' he said while adding that the investments under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are also immensely beneficial to the country and help domestic business environment.

China has vowed to invest more than $50bn in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) mainly concentrated in infrastructure, power, and communication projects. Pakistan's domestic production will benefit from overcoming infrastructure and power shortages, he said while commenting on the CPEC.

However, despite investments from China, Pakistan is facing a balance of payments crisis derived from a large current account deficit. Finance Minister Asad Umar recently said that Pakistan requires an additional amount of $9bn to fill the current account in the coming few months. Analysts expect Pakistan to approach International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an agreement to solve the crisis.

Mr Carson said that 'Pakistan will have to eventually decide whether it wants to approach IMF which is definitely an option or find other lenders but it must take a long-term approach while making key policy decisions.'

However, Mr Umar recently said that IMF is the last option and the current government is exploring other options which are being interpreted as seeking help from China and Saudi Arabia. Prime Minister Imran Khan along with Finance Minister Asad Umar arrived on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia on his first official foreign visit.

Ever since assuming office, Imran Khan has pushed for austerity shunning the grand lifestyle usually attached with country's political elite. Mr Carson, who was Citi's Country Officer for Greece and Cyprus during 2011-14, said Pakistan has the political will and leadership to successfully implement austerity measures in the country unlike Greece where similar measures were met with sharp rebuttal.

However, stakeholders are worried that delays in key decisions may cost the economy in long run.

Answering a question on the implications for Pakistan in worsening US-China trade war, he said that the country must position itself to find common ground with both countries. Pakistan has strengthened ties with China as relations with the US have frayed. He said the the country's relations with both global leaders should not be treated as mutually exclusive and the country's leadership can pursue better ties with both powers simultaneously.

The University of Sargodha (UoS) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Lanzhou University of China to enhance collaboration in academic, educational and cultural spheres in the next five years.

The agreement was signed by Lanzhou University president Professor Chun-Hua Yan and UoS Vice Chancellor Dr Ishtiaq Ahmad at the Lanzhou University.

Under its terms, the two universities have agreed to exchange faculty, administrative staff and students, collaborate on postgraduate training and education and share academic information and materials.

Under the previous MoU, the Lanzhou University is already extending its technical support to the UoS in the field of dry land agriculture, including the supply of the first consignment of technical equipment worth Rs25m.

The new agreement is broad and covers all aspects and levels of academic collaboration between the two institutions as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

'As the only public sector university included in China's Belt and Road Initiative's Agriculture League, we seek to expand our collaboration with Lanzhou University to Geological Sciences and other disciplines,' said Dr Ishtiaq Ahmad.

'We already have some 40 students doing postgraduate studies and research at our university and we expect this number to grow to 100 soon, including students and faculty from the Sargodha university,' said Prof Yan.


 
 

Cost of railways project under CPEC cut by $2bn: minister

Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid has said the cost of Pakistan Railways (PR) projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has been brought down.

'Railways is the backbone of CPEC and it makes no difference who is the minister or the officer. All PR projects under CPEC will continue,' Mr Rashid said at a news conference at the railways headquarters here on Monday.

He said that under the CPEC, railways was to upgrade its Karachi-Peshawar Main Line-1, stations and other strategic assets at a cost of $8.2 billion. 'We have brought down railways projects' cost to $6.2bn from $8.2bn in the PC-1 sent to the prime minister. It's my wish to further bring it down to $4.2bn. I am the biggest supporter of CPEC, but I also want that the railways has minimum burden,' he added.

The changes appear to be part of Islamabad's efforts to rethink the key Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects in Pakistan, where Beijing has pledged about $60 billion in financing but the new PTI government appears to be more cautious about the Chinese investment.

Sheikh Rashid says CPEC is like the backbone for Pakistan, but 'our eyes and ears are open'

'Pakistan is a poor country that cannot afford huge burden of the loans,' Mr Rashid says. 'CPEC is like the backbone for Pakistan, but our eyes and ears are open,' according to Reuters.

Reiterating that he would continue to initiate more projects under the public-private partnership policy, the minister said that plans were afoot to utilise railways land for industrial purpose. 'We are planning to invite the private sector to develop industrial zones along all major railway stations.'

A standard gauge track would be laid from Karachi and Peshawar, he said, adding that the existing broad-gauge track would be rehabilitated and upgraded under the CPEC.

Expressing the desire to expand the per annum commuter figure of PR to more than 70 million from the current around 55m, Mr Rashid said he would bring down rail fares up to Rs100 to attract passengers. He said that within a month or so after assuming office he had started the fourth passenger train. As part of the 100-day plan of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government, at least 10 new passenger trains would be launched and the per day number of cargo trains leaving Karachi for various upcountry destinations would be increased to 15 from the present 10 to 12.

In reply to a question, the minister said permission had been granted to recruit 2,031 people, but another 8,000 employees would be required to overcome the essential shortage of workforce. He said that during the upcoming foggy season, special equipment would be installed in locomotives of all trains to ensure safety and punctuality.

Coolies' red shirts

Coolies will again be in their iconic red shirts, some two years or so after their uniform was changed under a plan the railways administration had claimed would do away with the 'exploitative' system under which they (coolies) work.

An announcement to this effect was made by Railways Minister Rashid after inaugurating a new non-stop train Faisalabad Express at the Lahore railway station.

Under the plan, coolies were entitled to paid leave in case of injury or sickness, had rest rooms and a new uniform shalwar-kameez and turban, with kameez having yellow strips and green and yellow turban besides other facilities.

However, the plan was implemented to the extent of only switching to green and yellow from the nearly 150-year-old red shirt which made it easier to spot them on the crowded platforms.

Coolies had requested Railways Chairman Javed Anwar that they wanted back their trademark bright red shirt. 'The request has been accepted and orders have been given to restore the old uniform of coolies. Railways Chief Executive Officer Aftab Akbar will formally issue orders in this regard,' said the minister.

Dr Abbas Saeed Hakeem from the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Saudi Arabia, was the guest speaker. The workshop was held to build the capacity of students regarding modern technology.

Speaking on the occasion, UET Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Fazal Ahmad Khalid said more than 10 programmes were approved under the outcome-based education (OBE) system. He said they were going through a diverse era where different innovations were being made and various issues of engineering and technical skills were being resolved.

MONOGRAPH: The Centre for Public Policy and Governance at the Forman Christian College published a monograph on 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: Demands, Dividends and Directions'.

The monograph recommends urgent policy reform in the management of the CPEC projects to prioritise the potential of local economies and promotes a human development agenda in the design and implementation process.

The centre's monograph hopes to fill in the gap in literature by providing an academic, research-based interpretation to an area of study that has been driven by journalistic articles and reports, and ends with multiple perspectives on the CPEC in the broader context of the Belt and Road Initiative.


 
 

 China 's ' Belt and Road ', e-commerce to redefine shipping lines

The face of global shipping may be altered and seaborne trade flows and patterns redefined in the wake of new factors such as digitalisation, e-commerce and the China's 'Belt and Road' initiative which are increasingly unfolding, says a report issued by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).

'The value of shipping can no longer be determined by scale alone. The ability of the sector to leverage relevant technological advances to improve processes and operations, cut costs and generate value for the industry and customers, as well as the broader economy and society, is becoming increasingly important,' UNCTAD says in its Review of Maritime Transport for 2018.

UNCTAD projections are pointing to continued growth in world seaborne trade, which hinges on continued growth in GDP. At the same time, upside and downside risks to the outlook are manifold and include rising trade tensions on the downside and digitalisation on the upside.

At a time of growing concerns over the rise of protectionist sentiments, barrier to trade and trade disputes that may result in far-reaching detrimental impacts for the global economy and trade should be avoided to the extent possible, suggests the report.

Governments have a role to play by supporting the current positive economic trends and promoting a self-sustaining global economic recovery. This may entail, among other measures, commodity-dependent countries, it says.

According to the report, relevant regulatory authorities, maritime transport analysts, as well as development entities such as UNCTAD need to regularly monitor market concentration trends in liner shipping and assess potential implications in terms of market power, freight rates, surcharges and other costs to shippers and trade.

Governments, in collaboration with the shipping industry, the private sector, and the trade and business community need to build digital preparedness and promote greater uptake of relevant technologies. This will require, among others, providing an enabling legal and regulatory framework and supporting training and initiatives to build knowledge and upgrade skills.

All stakeholders, including governments, need to work together and support the development of transportation and supply chain infrastructure and services tailored for e-commerce.

The ongoing trade war between China and the United States can boost the prospects of Pakistani exports to the American market and encourage Chinese producers to relocate to Pakistan to avoid punitive tariffs on their US shipments and take advantage of cheaper labour.

On top of that, business leaders say it may afford Islamabad an opportunity to renegotiate the terms of China's future investments in and trade with Pakistan.

Abdul Razzak Dawood, adviser to the prime minister on trade, industry and investment, was quoted last week to have told a gathering of textile manufacturers in Karachi that the trade war between the world's two largest economies could be beneficial for Pakistan.

See: What's on everyone's mind in China-US trade war

'The trade war between China and the United States is getting bigger and bigger by the day… and the demand for goods is not declining (in the US market). Pakistan needs to explore ways so that it can benefit from this war.'

Chinese manufacturers can ward off punitive tariffs on their exports to the United States by relocating their labour-intensive industries to Pakistan, according to PBC CEO Ehsan Malik

Pakistan is already seeking the same market access for its exports that Beijing has given to the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), New Zealand and Australia under the 2006 Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that is responsible for heavily tilting the trade balance in favour of China.

Islamabad has also asked China to share complete information of its exports, both under and outside the FTA, with Islamabad in order to help it eliminate under-invoicing by Pakistani importers.

Moreover, efforts are on to convince Beijing to encourage its manufacturers to relocate their industry to Pakistan.

The adviser had also told a Senate panel on industries and production that China-US tensions over trade tariffs was a good sign for Pakistan as it would place the country in a better negotiating position (with China).

'The China-US trade war has put Pakistan in an advantageous position and we have become more competitive than China in some areas like textiles. It offers an opportunity for Pakistan to boost its exports to the United States as well as revive the closed manufacturing capacity (mostly in Punjab),' Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik told this correspondent.

He says Chinese manufacturers can also ward off punitive tariffs on their exports to the United States by relocating their labour-intensive industries to Pakistan.

'They (Chinese companies) can bring semi-finished goods and convert them into value-added goods for export to the United States. Then there are products that are made in China but not in Pakistan.

Such industries can also be relocated to Pakistan to avert higher US tariffs on Chinese exports.'

A Lahore-based textile exporter, who requested anonymity, was not too optimistic. 'In theory, we can take advantage of the American action against China. But we are not ready to benefit from it. We do not have enough capacity to fill the gap. Nor do we have developed our value-added textiles to replace China in the US market. I think countries like India and Bangladesh will have captured the US market by the time we are ready to even start thinking about benefitting from this opportunity.'

By far, China has shown a rather favourable view of most of Islamabad's demands. It has expressed willingness to take steps to boost its imports from Pakistan in view of the geopolitical advantages it will draw from the completion of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a part of the Belt and Road Initiative around which it has pledged to invest more than $60 billion in energy and transport infrastructure.

'The immediate benefit Pakistan can expect from China because of its worsening trade relations with the United States is improvement in trade terms and extension in the repayment period of loans taken for power projects under the CPEC initiative,' the anonymous textile exporter contended.

'It can be followed up with softer terms for future CPEC investments, relocation of Chinese textiles industry to Pakistan and transfer of technology and skills. My advice for the government will be to focus on these items.'

Prime Minister Imran Khan decided on Monday to shift the focus of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) from motorways to agriculture, job creation and foreign investment.

The decision was taken in a meeting presided over by the prime minister at Prime Minister Office.

'Earlier, the CPEC was only aimed at construction of motorways and highways, but now the prime minister decided that it will be used to support the agriculture sector, create more jobs and attract other foreign countries like Saudi Arabia to invest in the country,' Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry told Dawn while giving details of the meeting.

He said the prime minister's proposed visit to China was also discussed during the meeting.

The minister said Prime Minister Imran Khan will pay his first visit to China in the first week of November. 'Arrangements are being made for the visit and its date is yet to be finalised,' he said.

Meeting presided over by prime minister discusses his proposed visit to China next month

According to details of the meeting, the prime minister said strengthening the strategic cooperative partnership with China was the cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign policy and early implementation of the CPEC projects would help realise the true potential of Pak-China economic relations not only for the two countries but for the entire region.

Imran Khan said that CPEC was a great opportunity to learn from the Chinese experience, especially in the social, agricultural and other sectors.

He said that agricultural output of the country, considered as the backbone of economy, could be enhanced manifold by learning from Chinese expertise and employing latest technologies and efficient methods.

Prime Minister Khan stressed the need for focusing on early establishment of special economic zones in various parts of the country along the CPEC which would help the local industry grow through industrialisation and would also create huge employment opportunities for youths.

He said the CPEC under Belt and Road Initiative of President Xi Jinping also offered opportunities to other countries to invest in CPEC projects and reap benefits in various sectors.

'Like Saudi Arabia's initiative to invest in CPEC-related projects, Imran Khan has offered other countries to invest in it,' the information minister said.

Interestingly, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif at a meeting of his party in Lahore on Monday expressed concern over new agreements [Saudi investment] in the CPEC and claimed that a gulf was being created between China and Pakistan.

However, Prime Minister Imran Khan said the Pak-China friendship would be made stronger.

Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Finance Minister Asad Umar, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, Planning Minister Khusro Bukhtiar, Power Minister Omar Ayub, Advisers to Prime Minister Abdul Razak Dawood and Dr Ishrat Husain, the foreign secretary, secretary planning and other senior officials attended the meeting.

Last year China had temporarily suspended funding of road projects related to the CPEC till what the Chinese authorities said 'new guidelines' to be issued from Beijing.

It is expected that the prime minister will raise the issue during his meetings with the Chinese leadership.

Due to suspension of funds, over Rs1 trillion road projects of the National Highway Authority, which were in the pipeline, have been affected. It was also expected that not only road projects but ventures in other sectors of the CPEC, including power, could also halt.

The road projects affected by the decision included 210km Dera Ismail Khan-Zhob road which will be completed at a cost of Rs Rs81 billion Rs66bn will be spent on construction of road and Rs15bn on acquisition of land.

The estimated cost of 110km Khuzdar-Basima Road is Rs19.76bn construction of road to cost Rs14.5bn and land acquisition Rs5bn.

Remaining portion of the 136km of Karakoram Highway from Raikot to Thakot will be improved at a cost of Rs8.5bn.

It is expected that the funding of the three projects will be approved at a meeting of the Joint Working Group of the CPEC on Nov 20.

India will be invited to help with a key rail link in Afghanistan, during the visit of Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to New Delhi early next week, The Hindu reported on Thursday.

It also quoted an Uzbek presidential aide as eyeing an India-Pakistan rapprochement under the aegis of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).

The paper quoted a presidential aide as saying the proposed rail link of approximately 650km connecting the Afghan cities of Mazaar-i-Sharif and Herat which may later be extended to Kabul, is a major project agreed to by President Ashraf Ghani and President Mirziyoyev last year, and many of the preliminary surveys for the project have already been completed.

The Uzbek president will arrive in New Delhi on Sunday

'We support a greater presence of India in Central Asia, and hope for some benefits of that for Afghanistan. I hope that negotiations with PM Modi will open a new page in our bilateral relations,' Special Assistant for Foreign Affairs, Ilhom Nematov, told The Hindu during a visit to Delhi ahead of the president's visit beginning on Sunday.

'If India would be involved in [the railway line] construction, we would welcome them because of India's proven record and experience, and because of its contribution to bringing peace to Afghanistan,' he added, saying that Uzbekistan had an interest in open trade and connectivity routes 'all the way to the Indian Ocean'.

The project, for which Uzbekistan has already committed $500 million, could become another major regional connectivity project for India, after its construction of the Zaranj-Delaram Highway in Afghanistan and the Shahid Beheshti port in Iran's Chabahar, The Hindu said.

It said India is also committed to building another rail route, from Chabahar to Zahedan on the Iran-Afghan border, and President Mirziyoyev is keen to join the transit trade agreement signed by India, Afghanistan and Iran.

The rail route to Herat, if extended to Kabul, would also link to India's 'air corridor', allowing trade especially dry fruits and agricultural produce to travel along the routes from India to Central Asia and back in a much shorter time.

Uzbekistan has held talks with Iran, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and China, which is already running a rail route into Uzbekistan under the Belt and Road Initiative, for the same project in the past few months.

'Making a pitch for talks between India and Pakistan, Mr Nematov said Uzbekistan's role in regional security is likely to grow as it will take over as secretary general of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Jan 2019,' it said.


 
 

Govt fires back at critics of CPEC debt

Outflows under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will begin in 2021 and peak over the next three years without creating a debt trap, an official of the Planning Commission with knowledge of the financing arrangements told Dawn on condition of anonymity.

Separately, the Planning Commission released a lengthy statement trying to address the concerns of the global community about Pakistan's mounting Chinese debts and whether or not CPEC could turn out to be a 'debt trap' for Pakistan.

Most recently, the IMF Managing Director told reporters at a press conference in Bali on Thursday that the fund will demand 'absolute transparency' about all debt, without explicitly naming Chinese debt, whether under CPEC or not. A day earlier, the IMF Chief Economist Maurice Obstfeld told reporters that Pakistan should avoid 'excessive debts which cannot be repaid' when availing Chinese borrowing for infrastructure development.

By contrast, the planning commission official on Thursday said CPEC was rather being expanded and its pace expedited.

He said the debt repayments will start in 2021 with about $300-400 million annually and gradually peak to about $3.5 billion by fiscal year 2024-25 before tapering off with total repayments to be completed in 25 years.

The planning commissioned statement tried to strike a more earnest tone. 'CPEC is not imposing any immediate burden with respect to loans repayment and energy sector outflows' it said, arguing all debt related outflows will be outweighed by the resultant benefits of the investments to the Pakistan economy. The statement, however, did not give any figures on the size of the outflows or their timeline.

'The present government, with mutual consultation of Government of China is broadening the base and expediting pace of CPEC, within the broad parameters of the already approved CPEC framework'. A mechanism is being developed to include third party participation in CPEC, it added.

The commission reiterated that CPEC was a 'flagship' project and most active project of Belt and Road Initiative where 22 projects worth a total of $28 billion have been actualized over the past four years. 'The project could not be compared with Chinese overseas investment in Sri Lanka or Malaysia as frameworks and financial modes of CPEC are altogether different in nature' the statement continued.

CPEC finances are divided in government to government loans, investment and grants. Infrastructure sector is being developed through interest free or government concessional loans. Gwadar Port is grant-based investment which means the Government of Pakistan does not have to pay back the invested amount for the development of the port.

Energy projects are being executed under Independent Power Producers (IPPs) mode and finances are mainly taken by the private companies from China Development Bank and China Exim Bank against their own balance sheets, therefore, any debt would be borne by the Chinese investors instead of any obligation on part of the Pakistani government.

Pakistan has opted for Chinese investment under CPEC due to the favorable financing arrangements, it continued. 'China stepped forward to support Pakistan's development at a time when foreign investment had dried up, and economic activities were being crippled by energy shortages and infrastructure gaps.'

The statement described CPEC as 'an engine for economic growth and is expected to increase Pakistan's GDP growth by 2 to 3pc. CPEC has also facilitated in overcoming crucial energy, transport infrastructure and supply chain bottlenecks.'


 
 

US to review Chinese debt before decision on Pakistan's loan request

The United States said that it will examine closely Pakistan request for a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), adding that 'part of the reason that Pakistan found itself in this situation is Chinese debt'.

Asked at a Thursday news briefing how would the United States deal with Pakistan's request, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said: 'In all cases, we examine that closely from all angles of it, including Pakistan's debt position, in evaluating any type of loan programme'.

Take a look: The IMF's corrective measures will be harsh. Here's how the government can get straight to policymaking

Ms Nauert also blamed Pakistan's loan arrangement with China for the country's economic woes.

'I think part of the reason that Pakistan found itself in this situation is Chinese debt and the fact that there is debt that governments have incurred that they maybe thought wouldn't be so tough to bail themselves out of, but has become increasingly tough,' she said.

On Tuesday, IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld urged Pakistan to review the loans it was receiving from China and avoid 'excessive debts which cannot be repaid'.

Recently, a bipartisan group of 16 US senators claimed in a joint statement that China's Belt and Road Initiative, which also funds projects in Pakistan, was a debt-trap. The recipients often found themselves deeply in debt to China and were forced to make painful concessions, they warned.

In an interview to a US television network CNBC in July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States would not allow Pakistan to use the US taxpayers' dollars to repay China.

'Make no mistake: We will be watching what the IMF does,' he said.

Pakistani officials reject this argument, pointing out that their indebtedness to China is much smaller than imagined.

In an official statement issued in August, Islamabad pointed out that 'China stepped forward to support Pakistan's development at a time when foreign investment had dried up and economic activity was being crippled by energy shortages and infrastructure gaps'.

The United States is the largest contributor to the IMF and has 17.68 per cent of voting rights in major decisions. China is third, behind Japan, and controls 6.49 per cent of the vote.

In response to a separate question, Ms Nauert confirmed that an ambassadorial appointment for Pakis­tan 'is in the pipeline'.


 
 

The new Cold War

US Vice President Pence last week declared a new Cold War against China. America has now decisively stepped into the Thucydides Trap the Ancient Greek historian's thesis that a confrontation between an established and a rising power is almost always inevitable.

China was accused by Pence of multiple wrongs: unfair trade, technology theft, targeted tariffs, interference in the US electoral process, a military buildup, militarisation of the South China Sea islands (to keep the US out), 'debt diplomacy', anti-US propaganda and internal oppression. Pence declared that the US 'will not stand down' in opposing these alleged Chinese policies.

Some believe that the US salvo was mainly designed to divert attention from the ongoing investigation into Trump's possible collusion with Russia in the 2016 presidential elections and/or to mobilise votes for next month's mid-term elections.

The confrontation between the US and China is likely to escalate in words and deeds.

Yet, a deeper analysis indicates that Pence's broad anti-China indictment reflects the American 'establishment's' considered policy. The speech was preceded by national strategy papers describing China and Russia as America's adversaries, trade tariffs and investment restrictions, sanctions on Chinese military entities, renewed weapons sales to Taiwan and expanding US Freedom of Navigation operations in the South China Sea.

Chinese efforts to build a so-called 'win-win' relationship through trade concessions and cooperation on Korea and Afghanistan have clearly failed.

Chinese anger was visible during US State Secretary Pompeo's Korea-related visit to Beijing a few days ago, when Foreign Minister Wang Yi reportedly demanded that the US stop its confrontational 'behaviour'. The confrontation is likely to escalate in words and deeds. It will become increasingly difficult for either side to 'stand down'.

Apart from the raves of right-wing Americans, the Trump administration is unlikely to get much joy from the open confrontation with China.

The trade tariffs Trump has imposed are unlikely to return many manufacturing jobs to America since most Chinese goods will continue to be cheaper than their alternatives. US consumers will pay higher prices. The China-located supply chains of many US corporations will be disrupted, while China's supply chains are mostly outside of the US. Nor will technology restraints significantly dent China's 2025 technology programme, since it has already achieved considerable technological autonomy.

The Sino-US economic confrontation will have extensive consequences for the global economy. The IMF estimates that the US and China may lose one per cent and two per cent of growth respectively, while global growth would be trimmed by around half a percentage point. There are fears of another global recession as other economies become infected by the Sino-US trade war.

The prospects of the US 'containing' China in the Indo-Pacific are also marginal. This is China's front yard. The US allies and friends in East Asia even Japan, Australia and South Korea are economically intertwined with China and will be reluctant to confront it. US Freedom of Navigation operations could lead to accidental conflict, as almost happened recently. Short of war, the US cannot wrest the South China Sea islands from China. A reckless US decision to discard the One-China policy could unleash a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

Despite US objections, and Western propaganda, China's Belt and Road Initiative is unlikely to be derailed. Developing countries will not forego the opportunity to build infrastructure with Chinese financing. The 'debt trap' argument is misleading. Infrastructure investment rarely offers commercial returns. But no country can industrialise without adequate infrastructure. The US, with its parsimonious outlays on development cooperation, cannot offer an alternative to China's BRI.

The new Cold War will change the structures of global interaction and governance. Cooperation among the major powers on global issues (non-proliferation, climate change, terrorism) and in regions of tension (North Korea, Afghanistan, the Middle East) may be frozen. China, Russia and the countries in the Eurasian 'heartland' will draw closer together. Alternative trade, finance and development organisations will emerge to circumvent US domination of existing institutions.

The strategic dynamics of South Asia could also be transformed. Although India is attracted to America's overtures for an anti-China alliance, it also wishes to avoid the 'cost' of confrontation (Doklam) and to secure the benefits of trade and investment with China (the 'Wuhan spirit') as well as to maintain its arms supply relationship with Russia. The escalating Sino-US confrontation will compress the time and space for India to get off the fence and make a strategic choice between America and Russia-China.

Unlike India, Pakistan's choice is clear. Its strategic partnership with China is critical for its national security and socioeconomic development. This choice automatically implies a strategic divergence with the US. The only question is whether Pakistan can maintain a modicum of cooperation with the US despite the strategic divergence. Pakistan has some room for manoeuvre so long as the US remains in Afghanistan, with or without a political settlement there.

If India chooses to remain aloof from an alliance with US, and moves closer to China and Russia, it could radically alter the calculus of the political and economic relationships in the entire region. A Sino-Indian rapprochement would increase the prospects of Pakistan-India normalisation and a compromise 'solution' for Kashmir. The visions of regional 'connectivity' would become reality. However, this scenario is highly unlikely until after the 2019 Indian elections.

Although the new Cold War is wider and more complex than the old one, there is hope that it may not be as prolonged. US public opinion will soon see that confrontation with China (and Russia) is costly and counterproductive. A post-Trump Democratic administration may well decide to opt for the 'win-win' relationship proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Prime Minister Imran Khan has expressed the desire to learn from China how to fight the monsters of poverty, rampant corruption and downfall of agriculture sector.

'Pakistan would like to learn from Chinese experience in poverty alleviation, fighting corruption and agriculture development through sharing expertise, technology and best practices in the sector,' he said on Monday in a meeting with members of a visiting delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) headed by Minister of International Development of China Song Tao at the Prime Minister's Office.

Earlier, the prime minister received the delegation and hoped that its visit would further cement bilateral relations between the two countries.

PM Khan said the China International Import Expo, being held next month, would provide an opportunity to two sides to look into export possibilities from Pakistan to China.

President Xi Jinping's terming of this friendship as that of 'iron brothers' reflects an undeniable reality.

Mr Khan said President Xi was a great statesman for whom there was much admiration by the people of Pakistan.

Appreciating the growing relations between PTI and CPC, the PM emphasised on further enhancing these ties through exchange of delegations and sharing of ideas. On his upcoming visit to China, Mr Khan said he looked forward to his meetings with the Chinese leadership.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister Song Tao underscored the importance attached by the leadership and people of China to relations with Pakistan. He assured China's support to Pakistan at all regional international fora, as well as in addressing the agenda of poverty alleviation, fighting corruption and agricultural development.

Chinese minister said exchanges between political parties would help in sharing ideas to achieve common and shared development. He termed China Pakistan Economic Corridor as a flagship project of Belt and Road Initiative, which would make significant contributions towards building a 'new' Pakistan.

At a time when some major countries are overtly or covertly opposing China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that aims to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient routes of Silk Road, France has declared its support for China's gigantic programme.

Talking to Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Defence Production retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum, French Ambassador to Pakistan Marc Barety on Friday said: 'France supports the Chinese BRI concept and is ready to invest in the subsequent phases of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) provided transparency is ensured.'

The remarks came amidst reports suggesting that the United States, Australia, Japan and India were considering establishing a joint regional infrastructure scheme as an alternative to China's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative in an attempt to counter Beijing's spreading influence.

Ambassador says Paris ready to invest in subsequent phases of CPEC provided transparency is ensured

The ambassador also showed keen interest in the defence sector, but expressed his disappointment that French competing companies could not win any of the three tenders floated for radars, submarines maintenance and mobile bridges which were won by the companies from the US, Turkey and China, respectively. He pointed out that the submarines, for which the tenders for maintenance were floated, had been provided by France.

The committee chairman assured the ambassador that the procedures followed were transparent and French companies would always get fair chance to compete. Gen Qayyum said that Pakistan also looked forward to French investment in health, education, energy and especially in railways and connectivity.

The French ambassador said his country's investments in Pakistan would be enhanced in due course of time. He said that about 40 French companies, including Engie, TOTAL and Sanofi, were doing successful business in Pakistan and France wanted to enhance bilateral trade, which was presently only 1.4 billion Euros.

He said France and Germany were planning joint cultural events in Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar. He appreciated that in view of tremendous improvement in the security situation in Pakistan these events were being held with desired freedom. The ambassador informed the committee chairman that France was also opening French language institutes in Peshawar, Faisalabad and Karachi.

Gen Qayyum said Pakis­tan appreciated and welcomed France's willingness to increase its investments in Pakistan.

He also welcomed the French government's decision to participate in the forthco­ming Asian Parliame­ntary Association (APA) meeting scheduled to be held in Gwadar on Oct 29 and 30.

THE article, 'Strategic confines of CPEC' by Muhammad Amir Rana (Oct 21) is based on certain assumptions and opinions without corroboration of facts.

The China Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a flagship project of Belt and Road Initiative that provides enormous opportunities for to grow economically and sustainably. CPEC has also greatly facilitated in overcoming crucial energy, transport infrastructure and supply chain bottlenecks. The government of has repeatedly stated that it is fully committed to CPEC, which enjoys complete consensus among all institutions and political parties in .

It is unjustifiable to write that the present government is still 'musing' over how to deal with CPEC. Within the broad parameters of the already approved CPEC framework, the current government, with mutual consultation of government of China, has broadened the base and expedited the pace of CPEC. The cooperation is being ventured into new avenues in order to promote social sector development, focus on poverty alleviation, assist in low-cost housing, health care, clean drinking water, climate change and forestry as well as capacity building and vocational training.

The Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are open to all domestic, Chinese and foreign investors. The business community is fully onboard of the incentives and legal framework being offered to investors. The leaders from the community have also participated in the seventh CPEC Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) in this regard. The present government is further working to ensure early implementation of this key sector.

The CPEC framework has also been extended to cooperation in agriculture. The areas include agri-production diversification, water conservation and efficient utilization, processing and value addition for post-harvest handling, trade facilitation through product development and branding, cooperation in crop farming, livestock breeding, forestry, horticulture and fisheries, etc.

The government is fully aware of the dynamics of CPEC and has a clear-cut vision and road map on prioritizing projects that have economic viability and influence on 's social sector development.


 
 

CPEC moves into agriculture

A VERY interesting annexure in the latest State Bank's annual report provides much-needed detail on the entry of Chinese firms in Pakistan's agriculture sector. Agriculture appears to be one of China's top priorities in CPEC, contrary to how the Pakistani government has presented the enterprise as being built around transit trade. And now, possibly for the first time, we have an official source where this is fleshed out in further detail.

It begins by noting that the CPEC Long Term Plan (LTP) lays great stress on agriculture, with wide-ranging engagement across the entire sector. Boosting yields in the crop sector, reducing losses from harvest and transportation, and engaging with livestock and dairy are some of the thrusts envisaged under the plan. The eventual goal appears to be to boost Pakistan's food exports to China.

Exclusive: CPEC master plan revealed

The report adds this intriguing sentence, without elaborating: 'It is important to note that the nature and direction of such a progress critically depends upon changes currently under way in the agriculture sector of the Chinese economy.'

The annexure points out that agriculture is a big priority for China's overseas investments in all countries under the Belt and Road Initiative. The motivation is China's growing food deficit at home and the erosion of arable land.

'China's food import dependence is rising amidst continued degradation of arable land and depletion of its livestock and fisheries resources. To address these concerns, it is investing heavily under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by outsourcing its food supplies, while moving towards high value-added food products to contain its food trade deficit.'

The biggest concern in the whole enterprise is not mentioned: what does it mean for Pakistan's own food security?

So China is 'outsourcing its food supplies' to address its growing food-security vulnerability, and this involves growing investments in the agriculture sectors of other countries. The benefits for Pakistan are nicely laid out in the annexure. They include improved yields through superior seeds, mechanisation of farms as well as introduction of drip irrigation technology on a wider scale, increased use of formal credit systems for agri-lending, and greater documentation of the rural economy and especially its land registries.

Much work has already been done along these lines. For example, China has pursued hybrid rice cultivation in Pakistan for almost two decades now, trying new varieties that promise higher yields and are more temperature resistant.

This year, the first export consignment of hybrid rice was sent to the Philippines. Now more land is expected to be brought under rice cultivation after this initial marker of success. A programme has just been concluded in Mansehra, Swat, Sahiwal and Larkana (among other areas) to grow hybrid rice, where the testing was done on a certain variety to be grown under the very different temperature conditions in each of these regions.

Likewise, a cold storage station has been erected in Khunjerab, on the Chinese border, for seafood exports to China. It is active for eight months of a year, according to the annexure, and will handle sales to the Xingjian region, as well as Shanghai and Beijing according to the authors. As per the LTP, more cold storages are planned in Karachi, Gwadar, as well as Lahore and Peshawar.

Chinese enterprises are also scouting for possible investments in Pakistan's agrarian economy. More recently, 'on July 31, 2018, Fauji Foods Ltd disclosed on the stock exchange that Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Company Limited, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, has expressed interest in acquiring up to 51 per cent of the voting shares and/ or control in the former with the intention of expanding R and D operations and manufacturing high-value-added dairy products to be exported to China.'

This is an interesting strategy to acquire controlling stakes in a large agro enterprise in the country, then fanning outwards from there. In due course, cotton will also come on this radar, since the LTP has specifically mentioned the interest of Chinese officials in Pakistani yarn and coarse cloth to feed Xinjiang's growing textile industry.

Some structural problems will need to be addressed, the authors of the annexure state, for the benefits of this opportunity to flow smoothly for Pakistan. These include low levels of farmer literacy and awareness, low levels of formal credit for farmers, 'cluster farming' or the land holding pattern of the country where the majority of farmers own small pieces of land (typically 12.5 acres or less) which inhibits economies of scale poor state of land records and of course a highly dysfunctional water economy.

The biggest concern in the whole enterprise is not mentioned: what does it mean for Pakistan's own food security? Boosting agricultural yields and reducing losses in the food supply chain are clearly required for Pakistan, but as exports grow and more land is brought under water-intensive rice cultivation (as an example), what will happen to our local food needs?

Soon the enterprise will move into its next phase, where land acquisition for demonstration projects gets going and large agro enterprises in the country start being bought out, like what is happening with Fauji Foods Ltd. Long before that happens, it is imperative that the government of Pakistan ensures that the country's own needs are in the driving seat.

We need to ask whether new varieties of hybrid rice (particularly sticky rice) are the best place to lay the emphasis for the future of this engagement, since it means devoting large tracts of land as well as enormous water resources, to growing something that is not a staple food here. Perhaps more emphasis on wheat in the coming days will also materialise.

Pakistan's agriculture needs support of the sort that the Chinese are offering there is little doubt about that. But our agriculture is the lifeblood of our economy, and the biggest pillar of our stability is our hard-fought food security. There is very little bargaining room with these priorities.


 
 

The  China  agenda

NEXT week, Prime Minister Imran Khan will visit China, Pakistan's primary strategic partner.

The visit will take place at a critical moment in global politics. A new Cold War has been declared by the US against China and Russia. The world order established after the Second World War is being dismantled by the Trump administration. The US and other major countries no longer feel constrained by international law from the unilateral use of force, pressure and intervention against smaller states. The global trade regime is being torn apart. The financial system is under stress.

In these turbulent times, Pakistan's relationship with China provides an essential anchor for its security and foreign policy and the foundation for its socioeconomic development. China meets Pakistan's defence requirements; it is building Pakistan's infrastructure; it is a bulwark against aggression by India and bullying by the US.

There is need for more vocal Chinese support to Pakistan on its core security challenges.

Although Pakistan-China relations are rock solid, in the current geopolitical circumstances, when both Pakistan and China confront threats and pressure from their adversaries, it appears essential to elevate their strategic partnership to an even higher level.

The prime minister's visit to China was preceded a few weeks ago by that of Pakistan's army chief who is reported to have discussed the further development of defence and security cooperation between the two countries at very high levels in Beijing. The decisions for intensified security cooperation will no doubt be affirmed by the prime minister and Chinese leaders.

The two countries need each other's support on the political challenges they face at present. China will expect Pakistan's support on its maritime disputes in the South China Sea, on the One China Policy and Taiwan, and on the separatist threat from Uighur extremists in Xinjiang.

Given the concerted Indian and US pressure and threats against Pakistan, there is need for more vocal Chinese support to Pakistan on its core security challenges. China should condemn the threats of force and economic pressure on Pakistan; call for a peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with international law; and oppose all threats to disrupt the CPEC project. China's contribution is also essential to promote a political settlement in Afghanistan including by support for its development and incorporation into the CPEC and Belt and Road network.

The prime minister's agenda in China is likely to be focused on economic issues. Despite the most welcome Saudi financial support secured during the prime minister's tactically smart participation in the Saudi investment conference last week, Pakistan still requires a generous financial injection from China. This may come in various forms: dollar deposits, soft loans, commercial credit, currency swaps and enlarged CPEC commitments. China can also positively influence the negotiation and approval of the IMF package sought by Pakistan.

The prime minister has been invited to China's trade expo in Shanghai as a 'guest of honour' and will lead efforts to showcase Pakistan's export and production capabilities.

Unfortunately, these capabilities are currently limited and must be enlarged through appropriate trade and industrial policies. China can play a crucial role in this process, for instance, through a conscious endeavour to relocate some of its non-competitive manufacturing capabilities and those facing new Western trade barriers to Pakistan. The joint development of Pakistan's agricultural sector and export of agricultural commodities and processed goods to China also offer potential for expanding bilateral trade and accelerating growth and employment in Pakistan.

It appears essential for the prime minister to set at rest any doubts regarding Pakistan's commitment to the CPEC. This is the 'flagship' of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). If the US and its friends, including India, are successful in sabotaging CPEC, it will constitute a major foreign policy setback for China and its leader as well as for Pakistan.

The BRI is vital not so much for China as for the developing countries. The World Bank has estimated that developing countries need an investment of over $100 billion in infrastructure annually. The US and the West are unwilling or unable to finance this; China is doing so. Western opposition to BRI is essentially a 'dog-in-the-manger' approach. Criticism of BRI as 'debt diplomacy' is a misplaced extrapolation of the West's century-old strategy to 'capture' the resources and compromise the leaders of poorer nations. Chinese lending for government projects is provided on extremely soft terms.

All the projects under CPEC were selected by successive Pakistani governments. The Gwadar port, road and rail links, oil and gas pipelines, were identified during the Musharraf government. The power projects were added by the PML-N government. Most of these projects will help advance Pakistan's industrialisation and economic expansion.

As already agreed, CPEC's scope will be broadened in future. The Special Economic Zones can provide the avenue for rapid industrialisation and export expansion. CPEC can also incorporate 'social infrastructure': education institutions, healthcare facilities, garbage and sewage treatment plants, public amenities, housing projects, environmental protection projects.

Both Pakistan and China have expressed openness to third country participation in CPEC. Saudi investments in Gwadar will come alongside the CPEC projects. Some Western companies are already participating in and profiting from CPEC projects. General Electric has supplied turbines for three gas-fired power plants in the Punjab (whose 'teething problems' have delayed their start by almost a year). Four Thar Coal projects will also use GE turbines, hopefully, with better results.

It would be useful for Pakistan and China to establish a transparent and inclusive mechanism to accelerate CPEC implementation eg by prioritising CPEC projects, agreeing on terms of financing, overseeing timely execution and keeping the public and parliament informed.

The anticipated strengthening of the strategic partnership is not designed as an alliance against any third country (unlike the US-India relationship explicitly meant to 'contain' China). But the reinforced Pakistan-China partnership will enable both countries to more confidently confront the multiple challenges they face in an increasingly turbulent world. The Chinese pictogram for 'challenge' also means 'opportunity'. It is thus that Chairman Mao declared: 'There is great disorder under the heavens; the situation is excellent!'


 
 

FDI worries as external sector pressures mount

THE capacity of the national economy to cater to increasing domestic demand remains constrained by the low pace of both private and public sector savings, investment and capital formation. Meanwhile, the impetus provided for GDP growth from foreign capital and financial flows falters.

According to the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) annual report, net Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows to Pakistan increased marginally to $2.8 billion in FY18 from $2.7bn in FY17 as repatriation of profits by foreign companies increased. A further sharp drop of 42 per cent in FDI inflows was recorded during the first quarter of the current fiscal year.

Expressing dismay over the poor FDI inflow, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) President Irfan Wahab told newspersons that OICCI members expect the government will soon unveil growth-oriented economic and trade strategies especially some practical and out- of- the- box new policy initiatives to attract sizeable FDI and spur local investment.

The private sector wants policymakers to revisit its foreign investment policy so as not to crowd out local investment

For the past six years, FDI inflows have remained stuck at one per cent of GDP, much below the potential of three per cent estimated by OICCI.

The share of investment and exports in GDP growth pales into insignificance when compared to that of domestic consumption.

The contribution of domestic consumption to GDP rose to 93.2pc during FY18, up from 91.7pc a year ago significantly higher when compared to an average share of 88.7pc over the last five years.

Fiscal and monetary policies are now being re-oriented to depress domestic demand. Sharp depreciation of the rupee and its purchasing power, hike in policy interest rates and increase in customs tariff are designed to curb domestic consumption, particularly of imported goods, and create trade surpluses for export earnings.

Yet, these steps will make investment costlier.

Private sector investment is also likely to be adversely affected by falling public sector development.

During FY18 development spending declined by 6.5pc due to a sharp 20.6pc contraction in the federal public sector development programme and the provincial development expenditure slowing down to 3.3pc in FY18 from 43.8pc a year ago. This trend is unlikely to be reversed any time soon, at least as far as federal development spending is concerned.

According to the OICCI, many foreign research agencies have assessed Pakistan's retail sector as the fastest-growing market in the world worth approximately $150bn. The domestic market remains an attractive destination for foreign investors.

In the last fiscal year private sector credit to GDP ratio shot up to an eight-year high of 17.4pc although it remained lower than the peak of 27.2pc achieved just a decade ago. This ratio for Pakistan stands lower than that of other regional economies such as India (49.7pc), Bangladesh (47.6pc) and Sri Lanka (45.7pc).

As it is, Pakistan has been no exception to the global trend of nations focusing on their domestic market; even those developed economies, such as the US, which were earlier great champions of globalisation and free trade.

The PTI-led government is trying to attract FDI in commodity producing sectors from regional countries while apparently primarily seeking balance of payments support from the International Monetary Fund in order to ease external sector pressures.

Pakistan's imports which have a negative contribution to GDP were 2.3 times the country's exports in FY18. A World Bank report states that Pakistan may continue to breach the debt limitation law for next 10 years due to high expenditure and low revenue. The country has been in the breach of the said law since 2010.

During his visit to China next month Prime Minister Imran Khan is expected to ask the Chinese to shift their focus to investments in agriculture and industry. Efforts are already underway to attract investment to boost food production for exports to China.

Nine agriculture zones are planned along CPEC to produce commodities in demand in the Chinese market as China is investing heavily under the 'Belt and Road Initiative' to outsource its food supplies.

Construction of food storage and processing zones is planned to reduce post-harvest losses in Pakistan. A chain of cold storage stations and meat processing plants will be built to enhance productivity. And the domestic private sector is seeking joint venture foreign partners for industrial projects.

The private sector wants policymakers to revisit its foreign investment policy so as not to crowd out local investment in such areas as the domestic consumer industry. The Pakistan Business Council says FDI should be welcomed in sectors where the domestic private sector has neither the capacity nor the appetite to invest.


 
 

Rajapaksa's return

A PAIR of prime ministers, an embattled president, and a brewing constitutional crisis: the scenario that has been unfolding in one of Asia's oldest democracies over the past three weeks occasions a mixture of ­fascination and alarm.

Sri Lanka's post-colonial history has been peppered with bouts of instability and bloodletting. It came as a pleasant surprise when Maithripala Sirisena defeated his former boss, Mahinda Rajapaksa, in the 2015 presidential election with the backing of the United National Party (UNP)-led opposition, although the subsequent government of national unity perhaps inevitably proved to be a shaky coalition.

Late last month Sirisena sought to dismiss veteran UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister, replacing him with none other than Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has thus far refused to budge, and his allies as well as constitutional experts have questioned Sirisena's right to fire him after having ceded most of the presidency's executive powers early on in his tenure.

China's economic incursions are causing anxiety in South Asia.

In keeping with democratic norms, the dispute ought to have been resolved in parliament, but Sirisena, aware that Wickreme­singhe still commanded a majority, suspended the legislature, while hectic efforts ensued to win over legislators, reportedly with substantial bribes. When that tactic did not sufficiently pay off, Sirisena decided to dissolve parliament and schedule a snap election for Jan 5, actions struck down yesterday by Sri Lanka's Supreme Court.

The Rajapaksa government is yet to be widely recognised internationally, although Beijing was quick to do so. It is useful to remember in this context that during Rajapaksa's decade long tenure as president (2005-15), China rarely turned down a request for investment, provided its conditions were met. It was happy to advance loans for infrastructure as long as the construction project was entrusted to Chinese firms.

As a consequence, Sri Lanka was saddled with debt worth billions of dollars plus at least a couple of white elephants. One of these, the gleaming Mattala Rajapaksa international airport, lost its only daily commercial flight when FlyDubai airline dropped it from its schedule. The same southern district, which just happens to be the Rajapaksa family's ancestral homeland, also boasts a cricket stadium with a seating capacity greater than the population of its largest town.

Even grander, and more controversial, is Hambantota Port, which was handed over to China last December, alongside 15,000 acres of surrounding land, for 99 years in lieu of loan repayments that Sri Lanka could no longer afford. The agreement stipulates that Chinese naval vessels cannot visit the underused port without explicit permission from the Sri Lankan government. Would that be much more than a formality were Rajapaksa and his brothers who controlled the key ministries less than a decade ago to regain control of national affairs?

India is not alone in viewing with anxiety Chinese economic incursions in its neighbourhood and suspecting that long-term strategic aims are woven into Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. It isn't just in geopolitical terms, though, that the idea of Mahinda Rajapaksa's re-ascendancy provides cause for consternation. His domestic record too was devastating. Any credit for crushing the long-running Tamil separatist insurgency must be weighed against the huge cost in civilian lives, but besides the credible allegations of war crimes there were routine violations of human rights elsewhere alongside curbs on the freedom of expression.

These, alongside widespread claims of corruption, have gone largely uninvestigated and unpunished since 2015, des­pite official promises to the contrary.

There can be little doubt that, despite everything, Raja­paksa has managed to retain substantial support among the Sinhalese majority, and his party performed exceptionally well in last February's municipal elections. He was, in fact, among the first of the 21st century's popular strongmen to throw his weight about, and the phenomenon has gathered steam in recent years. (Sirisena, too, wasn't exactly immune to its attractions, indicating back in July that he was willing to lift a moratorium on executions that has been in place since 1976, in order to emulate the Philippines' exceptionally brutal method of combating drug crime.)

For the moment Rajapaksa lacks a democratic mandate. Unfortunately, though, it seems likely he will acquire one soon enough. This week he formally switched from the Sirisena-led Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) previously associated for around five decades with the Bandaranaike family to his own Sri Lanka People's Party alongside 44 SLFP legislators in the suspended/ dissolved parliament.

Regardless of whether the present crisis festers or is rapidly resolved, it points to a period of gloom for the island nation. But you can safely bet at least a few sunny smiles will bloom in Beijing as soon as Rajapaksa is unequivocally back in charge.

I WAS alive when The Civil and Military Gazette (where Rudyard Kipling cut his teeth as a cub reporter) was closed down. I was alive when The Pakistan Times was shut down and its editor Faiz Ahmed Faiz had to revert to writing poetry. I was alive when the magazine Outlook cleared its desks after its courageous owner/editor I.H. Burney conceded defeat. I was alive when The Morning News ran its last impression in Karachi. And I am alive today, to feel the same cold steel scythe of censorship.

There is no government in the history of Pakistan that has not tried to apply censorship, with varying degrees of failure. Press censorship is usually an instrument of war. Here, we keep it oiled, ready for use during peacetime.

Few of our ministers of information have been as forthcoming as the late Altaf Gauhar, once the mouthpiece of President Ayub Khan. In his memoirs, published in 1993, Gauhar mentions how during the 1965 war, 'all those lists under which successive governments had debarred certain political activists, poets and writers were withdrawn. Almost instantaneously the official information network was transformed into the voice of the nation'.

Our new government, like all its predecessors, wants a pliant media.

Which selected government has not aspired to be 'the voice of the nation'? Which has not commandeered the role as the ideological fount of nationalism from which all truth flows?

The true test of freedom of speech in any country is if there is freedom after the speech. Saudis learned that lesson as they watched their compatriot the dissident Jamal Khashoggi make a fatal visit to their country's consulate in Istanbul. What emerged was not a chastened journalist but a reminder of G.B. Shaw's dictum: 'Assassination is the extreme form of censorship.'

We in the subcontinent do things differently. In June 1975, during the Emergency declared by Mrs Indira Gandhi, she and her son Sanjay expressed their displeasure with the then minister of information I.K. Gujral. Mrs Gandhi demanded to see the radio and TV scripts of all news bulletins. Gujral protested that even he did not get to see the scripts. 'She snapped back that whether he saw them or not, the prime minister wanted to see them.'

Our new government, like all its predecessors, wants a pliant media to present its performance in as positive a light as credibility permits. It would have the public believe, for example, that the prime minister's recent visit to China was an unmitigated success, that his reception in Beijing by the Chinese Minister of Transport Li Xiaopeng (the lowest in the list of non-voting alternate members of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party) or by the deputy mayor of Shanghai was in accordance with traditional protocol.

His meetings with the Chinese leadership are described as a reaffirmation of Pakistan's centripetal position in President Xi Jinping's One Belt One Road policy, and the final communiqué as a tacit exoneration of Imran Khan's unwise criticisms of CPEC from the roof of his container, repeated and then denied by his adviser on commerce Mr Razak Dawood. These cleansing contentions need to be reflected in the government's official CPEC website which incidentally still lauds former minister Mr Ahsan Iqbal's interaction with his Chinese counterpart a year ago.

The Chinese may misplace old memories; they never forget them. The Chinese have not forgotten the 1963 agreement by which Ayub Khan gave them Aksai-Chin. They have not forgotten that in 1971 president Yahya Khan facilitated their dialogue with the United States. They have not forgotten that in May 1976 they allowed Mr Z.A. Bhutto to be the last foreign leader to meet the dying Chair­man Mao Zedong. They have not forgotten the $64 billion they have extended under CPEC, even slipping under its ­covers at the last minute Shahbaz Sharif's beleagu­red Orange Line project.

Put that largesse into perspective. According to a recent study, 'between 2000 and 2014, China gave about $75 billion, and lent about $275 billion' across the world. And President Xi Jinping will not have forgotten that his visit in September 2014 had to be postponed because a political party now in power had rendered Islamabad a security risk.

China may have a thick wallet and be in a spending mood but the dividends it expects are of cooperation, not criticism, especially not from an 'iron brother'. The Chinese no longer use Chairman Mao's pronouncements as a vade mecum. Pakistani governments should. 'Make criticism in good time,' Chairman Mao had advised, 'don't get into the habit of criticising only after the event.'

There is not one thinking person in Pakistan who does not wish every government elect, select or otherwise success. Yet experience indicates that our votes are not passes to a better future but season tickets to disappointment.

THIS is apropos the article, 'Strategic confines of CPEC' (Oct 21) by Muhammad Amir Rana. The writer seems a bit confused while addressing the geostrategic potential of the CPEC.

He is of the view that geostrategic enterprise mixed with geopolitical purview will hurt the essence of the CPEC project i.e., foreign direct investment. Moreover, he has also said that 'for investors from Europe and North America, it is hard to invest in China-led strategically important projects.'

In the US-led world order where protectionism and placing tariff are highly emphasised, the foreign investors, especially from Europe, have become eager to invest in China-led projects. This can be gauged from the fact that France, in the recent Asia-Europe Meeting, has expressed its interest in participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.

As regards his geostrategic perspective of the CPEC, the writer has also failed to understand that it is the CPEC project which has enabled Pakistan to shift from geostrategic to geo-economic perspective.


 
 

NON-FICTION: THE EVOLUTION OF HINDUTVA

'Ghar wapsi' [return home] is the deceptive euphemism employed in 'secular' India to convert Indian Muslims and Christians to Hinduism. They are, so goes the theory, descendants of converts originally Hindu. So making Indian Muslims and Christians change their religion and become idol-worshippers is like welcoming them home hence ghar wapsi.

Christians are not the problem; Muslims are, as the book The RSS: A View to the Inside by Walter K. Andersen and Shridhar D. Damle reveals, as it takes the reader through the evolution of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's (RSS) political philosophy from its founding in the pre-independence days to a 21st century India placed better in terms of advancing the Hindutva cause. A bewildering variety of terminology, dogma and pseudo-intellectual exercise go into this proselytising effort to make it acceptable to normal human beings. It still leaves out, of course, a large number of Indians appalled by their country's slide into officially sponsored bigotry.

Founded by Dr Keshav Baliram Hedgewar more than two decades before independence, the RSS is now the world's largest NGO, with nearly two million 'participants' at 75,000 daily meetings of its various branches spread all over India. Dr Hedgewar was bitter about the long Muslim and 'Christian' (British) rule in India and held the Hindu caste system and social division responsible for what the authors call 'a thousand years of foreign domination' a theme articulated by Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the Indian parliament on May 14, 1970, when he said, '… sir, Hindus will no more take a beating in this country. The tradition of taking a beating went on for 700-800 years.' V.S. Naipaul gives the reason why: in his book India: A Wounded Civilisation, Naipaul, as quoted by the authors, talks about the 'deep wounds on the Hindu psyche caused by centuries of Muslim and British rule, such as the colonial historians' portrayal of Hindu men as effete and lacking in martial virtues.'

The development of the pro-Hindu RSS and its influence on Indian politics

That Islam and Muslims are an obsession with elements within the RSS and, perhaps, in large sections of the Hindu community was to be seen in their reaction to the 1981 conversion of 180 families of low-caste Hindus (Dalits) to Islam in a village in Tamil Nadu. They interpreted the conversion as highlighting the vulnerability not only of low-caste Hindus, but also of Hindus generally, to flight from Hinduism. This fear of 'Hinduism in peril' led to a campaign by the RSS and other groups to strengthen what the authors call 'Hindu solidarity.' So frightened was then RSS secretary general H.V. Seshadri that he claimed in an article that a Muslim Action Committee had been formed to convert millions of Dalits to raise the percentage of Muslims in Bihar, to 'carve out in the first instance, independent, Islamic States in Bharat […] and finally to Islamise the entire Bharat.' Vajpayee went a step further and said the conversions were part of 'a sinister conspiracy … to undermine the demographic and secular complexion of the country and turn it [in]to a theocratic state [such as] Pakistan and Iran.'

Banned twice, first in 1948 after Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's assassination, and again during the 1974-75 emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, the RSS initially kept itself aloof from politics and insisted that education was its 'core aim.' Hindutva, it said, was misunderstood and for that reason the RSS's aim was to reorganise 'Hindu society on the lines of its unique national genius' and carry it to the 'pinnacle of glory.' However, for a party with roots in Hinduism, staying away from politics was not possible for long. Gradually it was sucked into politics and played a major role in giving Indian politics a communal colour and paving the way for the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which, according to the authors, considers the RSS its 'ideological godfather.'

Yet in spite of its commitment to Hindutva, BJP realised that a blatantly communal approach and a crude attempt at conversion would frighten Muslims and Christians away and that what was needed was a more restrained, cultural rather than religious approach.

In 2014, one of the pro-Hindutva leaders, Rajeshwar Singh, embarrassed the BJP party leadership by coining the phrase 'love jihad', which alleged that Muslims were marrying Hindu girls to convert them to Islam. The same year, at a well-publicised event at Agra, Singh claimed he had converted around 100 Muslims to Hinduism. This followed his declaration earlier that 'the Muslims and Christians do not have any right to stay here. So they would either be converted to Hinduism or forced to run away from here.' This created a storm in India and embarrassed the ruling BJP.

In 1977, the RSS had changed its policy and threw open its membership to Muslims. Two and a half decades later it decided to seek Muslim cooperation and created a new organisation for Muslims only: the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM). The RSS leadership argued that instead of launching a movement to convert Muslims to Hinduism, the emphasis should be on making Indian Muslims accept 'Hindu culture' the way Indonesian Muslims had accepted it.

Andersen and Damle's book dwells on other aspects of what can be called the RSS phenomenon: the Gujarat riots presided over by then chief minister Narendra Modi (254 Hindus and 790 Muslims killed), the demolition of the Babri Masjid, the cow protection issue and the moral policing by the youth organisation Bajrang Dal whose followers can be called Hindu Taliban using the threat of violence against the media for spreading 'obscenity', pledging protection to Hindu traditions against insults, resisting such 'Western values' as Valentine's Day cards and parties and opposing illegal immigration.

Of special interest for the people of Pakistan in this book is the Indian diaspora's role in influencing their host governments' policies toward their country of origin, especially the part the Indian community in America played in getting Congress to pass the nuclear cooperation treaty in 2008, besides the reception given to Modi during his last visit to the United States.

A point Pakistani political parties should note is the close attention the RSS leadership pays to foreign affairs, especially where Pakistan and China are concerned. Chapter 9 dwells at length on India's relations with America, China and Pakistan and shows the deep insight the RSS has on issues of vital interest to India. As emphasised by many Indian analysts, the RSS believes nothing should be done that could adversely affect ties with Beijing. The RSS expresses concerns on many issues, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, especially where it concerns Pakistan, the South China Sea controversy, Beijing's refusal to help on a permanent Security Council seat for New Delhi, the Ladakh territory and China's veto on the Security Council with regard to Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar. But like all Indian governments, the RSS believes the red line should not be crossed, because New Delhi cannot afford losing its lucrative Chinese market and driving it closer to Pakistan.


 
 

Dreams and expectations

LED largely by a jubilant CPEC discourse in recent years, Pakistan-China ties have entered a review and rationalisation phase. The outcome of this process has yet to be seen, but it has already started to raise expectations on both sides.

On the eve of Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to Beijing, many in Pakistan were anticipating maximum economic cooperation from China at least a six-billion-dollar package. This anticipation rested on their idea of the strategic significance that Pakistan has for the Chinese dream of comprehensive global connectivity for China's economy. As it appears now, China is more concerned about the early completion of the CPEC projects under way. Perhaps it had not experienced any uncertainty about the fate of CPEC projects since the initiative was launched in 2013.

In fact, both countries have been caught in their own trap of CPEC sloganeering, with 'game changer' being a popular catchphrase. They are back to the basics now and trying to find ways for broader cooperation that takes them beyond CPEC.

The CPEC initiative came at a time when Pakistan's economy was under severe stress and its relations with the US were at a low point. Pakistan perceived CPEC as a groundbreaking project that would shift its economic and defence cooperation needs towards China. However, China was not willing to take America's place and, instead, wanted Pakistan's geo-economic cooperation to make its Belt and Road Initiative a success. In fact, these divergent motives were not properly thought through during the inception phase; nor had the two sides realised the future complications. While for China, CPEC was a tool to achieve its broader connectivity goal, Pakistan perceived it as an antidote to all its ills ranging from economic to geopolitical.

Both Pakistan and China have been caught in their own trap of CPEC sloganeering.

Domestically, the trade and investment atmosphere was made China-friendly. The government and bureaucracy even discouraged companies from other regions to invest in Pakistan. Initially, it proved an ideal equation for Chinese companies, but the demand to bring things into the public discourse and make them transparent annoyed them. In the regional and strategic context, too, Pakistan's dependence on China increased.

An interesting comment has been made that China wants a partner for its geo-economic ambitions but Pakistan is in search of another America. Pakistan's strategic compulsions have been shaping its foreign policy orientation, including bilateral ties with China.

On the other hand, China has a global dream, which is linked to an ambitious idea of rejuvenation where it sees itself as a leader of global governance. The BRI is an instrument to fulfil this dream. Through geo-economic connectivity, China will develop its soft power, which will also help it to boost its geo-strategic and political advantages.

Soft power needs a soft image; a state with authoritarian traits cannot develop this image. However, China is trying to develop compatibility with global norms without compromising on what are its core principles. Renowned economist Dambisa Moyo, in her recent book Edge of Chaos: Why Democracy is Failing to Deliver Economic Growth and How to Fix It, has argued that systems like the one in China could become more prevalent despite their severe implications for individual liberties.

China's economic growth and its success story of poverty reduction have caught the attention of many nations including Pakistan. These two factors are boosting its image as a soft power. To sustain this image, China would have to avoid initiating confrontation in the region and the world at large. Where the ongoing trade war between the US and China is concerned, many analysts believe that this will not be protracted as it would have negative consequences for both sides in the longer term.

China is also cultivating a new geo-economic relationship in its immediate neighbourhood where it is attempting to pacify tensions. Its relations with Japan are changing rapidly, and trade and economic cooperation are transforming bilateral ties. During Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recent visit to China, both sides agreed to resolve all their issues through constructive high-level dialogue.

China and other major actors in the South China Sea tensions are trying to pacify the situation, with China increasing its geo-economic ties in the region. The Philippines have recently signed agreements involving economic cooperation and China has agreed to provide $73 million in economic and infrastructure assistance to the country.

China is following a similar approach in South Asia as it moves to transform its relations with India. In Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's words, '...the strategic value of China-India cooperation will speak for itself, and there will be a prospect of the dragon and the elephant dancing together'.

For Pakistan, the challenge is how to develop compatibility with the ambitious Chinese designs without compromising on its conventional strategic objectives. China cannot portray its adversaries as enemies to forward its geo-economic and political interests. The challenge for Pakistan becomes more complex when it does not want to be tagged as a client state but still finds it hard to diversify its strategic, economic and diplomatic relations.

However, albeit gradually, Beijing, Riyadh, Istanbul and to some extent Moscow have become significant in Pakistan's relations with the international community and in managing its ties with Washington, Delhi, Kabul and Tehran.

Pakistan may not be expecting much from China in financial terms, but the latter country would have certain expectations. These expectations vary from concessions for Chinese companies in Pakistan to the latter's role in regional affairs. China does not want an escalation in tensions in its neighbourhood whether these are in South, East or Central Asia. These tensions vary from extremism and terrorism to border disputes and they attract global attention, which is not good for CPEC or the BRI as a whole.

The economy and relations with its neighbours remain Pakistan's main challenges. These can be addressed if the power elites come out of their hibernation.


 
 

Investing in Pakistan

NOW that the financial emergency is over (with Saudi and Chinese financial support), and hopefully an IMF programme will be in place soon, the government must turn to adopting the trade, industry and investment policies required to accelerate growth, generate jobs, restrain imports and expand exports on a sustained basis.

As an initial step, the sectors and products which have the greatest potential for export growth should be identified and promoted.

Textiles is Pakistan's prime export sector. It has been stagnant for several years due to low investment in modern machinery, energy shortages, an artificially strong rupee and inadequate efforts to integrate into global supply and retail networks. Both the government and industry appear ready to redress these deficits.

Sectors and products with the greatest potential for export growth should be identified and promoted.

Agriculture also has bright prospects. Pakistan is food self-sufficient. Yet, its agricultural yields are comparatively low. A considerable agricultural surplus can be generated through the application of new technologies and techniques; improved seeds, planting and harvesting methods; efficient irrigation and fertiliser use; better storage facilities, access to markets, packaging and branding.

Pakistan's manufacturing sector is minuscule one fourth the size of the services sector. But, with its high propensity for consumption, Pakistan imports all kinds of manufactured goods. Low industrialisation is a consequence of the folly of past unthinking trade liberalisation. No one will manufacture an item in Pakistan if it can be more cheaply imported into the country. Pakistan can industrialise only if the government acts decisively to protect and promote its infant industries until they are in a position to compete with regional and global producers.

Since a number of Chinese manufacturing industries are becoming less competitive and/ or facing high US and European tariffs, there is a significant opportunity to work with Chinese partners to transfer such industries to Pakistan, and use it as an export platform. Such targeted transfers should be a special focus of CPEC's Special Economic Zones.

Affordable and indigenous energy will be key to sustained growth. Renewable energy must be the clear preference. Despite high capital outlays, hydropower costs three cents per kilowatt hour. And solar power at four to five cents and wind at seven to eight cents are cheaper than imported fossil fuels and can serve off-grid areas. Approvals for the pending 2,500 MW solar and wind projects mentioned by the Sindh energy minister should be speedily issued. The installation of one or more solar panel production plants in Pakistan would be a profitable venture.

Pakistan may have delayed exploiting Thar coal far too long. Reportedly, electricity from the Thar coal power plants will cost eight cents per kilowatt hour. The environmental impact of coal power plants will be enormous. Future financing for coal-fired plants may not be available, unless new technologies can offer solutions. The Sindh government, for example, has been introduced to a technology which claims to capture waste coal flue gases and transform them into profitable products ammonia, water or methanol thus resolving both the environmental and economic problems encountered by coal.

Natural gas will need to be part of Pakistan's energy mix, given its extensive gas distribution system and the dependence of households and industry on natural gas. Pipeline gas would be cheaper than LNG imports; but the Turkmenistan pipeline must await peace in Afghanistan, and the Iran pipeline will evoke US 'secondary' sanctions. Consequently, in the short term, there is no alternative to additional LNG terminals/ imports.

Gwadar's full potential should be tapped. It was conceived not only as a transshipment port but also as a petrochemical centre. The planned Saudi refinery is a first step towards that vision. Crude and white oil pipelines from Gwadar upcountry and to China should be the next objectives.

An upgrade of Pakistan's rail system is overdue. China is providing the heavy financing required. It may be wiser to 'leapfrog' to instal the most modern Chinese high-speed rail system rather than one which is already behind the times.

A considerable part of government revenues and most foreign 'assistance' will have to be deployed to realise the PTI's social objectives:

Education, where Pakistan must play 'catch up' through massive literacy and vocational training programmes.

Healthcare, where the government's idea of providing a health card is a good concept; but faces the problem of the virtual absence of the required health services. Health facilities need to be built up, including through public-private partnerships.

Social infrastructure, ie clean drinking water, waste management, urban and rural transport and affordable housing, is essential to improve people's quality of life and can be built also through public-private ventures.

Policy support, where i1nstitutions like Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation and Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation, need to be revived and professionally staffed to guide efficient implementation of various development programmes.

The finance minister's concept of a sovereign wealth fund has not been fully elaborated. Adequate financing and expertise will have to be mobilised, domestically and internationally, to restructure and revive the myriad public corporations.

Pakistan's private capital will be fully deployed if assured of policy clarity and consistency, official integrity, fair dispute resolution and reasonable returns. Close interaction between the government, the Pakistan Business Council and the various chambers is essential.

Pakistan's capital market can be a growing source of investment finance through enhanced project financing, public listings and corporate bond issues.

Externally, China can be expected to maintain and enlarge its commitments under CPEC, especially if projects are efficiently executed. Chinese companies could be encouraged to take larger equity stakes in commercial projects.

Given the positive Saudi and UAE positions, considerable investment can be mobilised from the numerous sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, private equity funds, banks and family offices in the GCC. The government should encourage the creation of Pakistan-focused private equity funds to enlarge its financing sources and options.

Western companies may remain reluctant to enlarge their participation in the Pakistani economy unless the US reverses its negative posture and includes Pakistan in the Asian economic initiative it is launching to compete against China's Belt and Road Initiative.

Although Pakistan offers attractive investment opportunities, financing these will require a well-considered and executed plan including a marketing campaign to 'sell' these opportunities sector by sector and project by project. The government must gird up for this vital task.


 
 

Attempting to fine-tune the CPEC strategy

WITH its reservations over project priorities, the newly elected government decided to review the country's CPEC strategy and launch an action plan within its first 100 days to transform the project into 'a real game changer' for Pakistan.

In its view Pakistan was not fully benefiting from CPEC-related investments due to insufficient transfer of knowledge and capabilities, lesser partnerships with local businesses and high dependence on imports of goods and services from China.

The PTI manifesto had pledged to: 'Create a two-way linkage with China and promote an indigenous-focused growth strategy and leverage trade infrastructure, and utilise Chinese expertise, latest technologies and efficient methods to supplement domestic manufacturing capabilities and enhance yield in agriculture.'

It also promised to: 'Promote local value addition through joint ventures and value added exports, facilitate the integration of Pakistani manufactures with the global value chain, and ensure that Pakistani businessmen are fully involved in CPEC policy and project implementation.'

The joint statement and the continuing dialogue do not indicate a shift in CPEC strategy

A nine-member committee was set up to suggest ways to create space for the PTI agenda in the CPEC programme with marked preference for social and human resource development, investment, uplift of agriculture, industrial parks and export-oriented industrialisation.

Prime Minister Imran Khan was keen to expedite the stipulated programme scheduled for the second phase of the CPEC.

The minister for planning and economic reforms instructed the relevant authorities to fast track the process of establishing Special Economic Zones so as to achieve groundbreaking within three months.

Nine such CPEC zones are to be set across the country to attract foreign industrial investment.

Board of Investment Chairman Haroon Sharif says Pakistan will have to develop an 'island'(s) on the pattern of Dubai International Financial Centre where the country's laws do not apply.

'We have to insulate foreign investors from the jurisdiction of state institutions, courts and laws to give them a 'sense of security' in order to attract foreign direct investment,' he said.

Thus Prime Minister Khan went to China with a heavy agenda, the centrepiece of which was an integrated trade, investment and financial package.

Prime Minister Imran Khan was keen to expedite the stipulated programme scheduled for the second phase of the CPEC

The hope was that Chinese aid could help Islamabad reduce the size of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout and enhance the possibility of minimising the Fund's conditions related to the stabilisation programme.

But, apart from a stipulated doubling of Pakistan's exports to China with in the near-term, the package is still under discussion with no timelines set for the negotiations.

While expressing in a joint statement their satisfaction with the 'operationalisation of the currency swap arrangements', both sides agreed to 'strengthen cooperative ties in financial and banking sectors'.

The currency arrangement has yet to make any meaningful dent in bilateral trade which continues to be conducted mainly in dollars, and Beijing has supported Pakistan's move to access the IMF credit facility to resolve its unfavourable balance of payments problem.

While the prime minister's visit has been billed as a success by both sides given the stipulated widening of bilateral economic cooperation it is difficult to speculate about the outcome of continuing opaque bilateral discussions on specifics.

The joint statement appears more to be an expression of vision and mission about a strategic partnership and shaping of common destiny without any deviation from the CPEC course already set.

Thus, following the premier's visit, some analysts are of the view that Pakistan's expectations from China should be realistic, based on an understanding of CPEC's status and role in Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative (BRI).

After all, to quote an expert with intimate knowledge, 'CPEC is a mere cog in a giant wheel' as CPEC projects have the potential to feed into the larger BRI structure embracing 60 countries located in different continents.

The view has found support in the joint statement in which leaders: 'Affirmed their compete consensus on the future CPEC trajectory' and 'agreed to protect all (CPEC) projects from all threats.'

Since CPEC 's original guidelines and principles have laid down four priorities: Gwadar port, energy, transport infrastructure and industrial cooperation. This means infrastructure projects cannot simply be wished away.

And non-commercial projects on social and economic development are also part of the original CPEC programme, although Mr Khan did succeed in getting a part of the PTI agenda included in the joint statement for early initiation and implementation.

Both countries agreed to set up a working group on socio-economic development and China has agreed to support Pakistan in establishing poverty alleviation demonstration projects.

But the joint statement and the continuing dialogue do not indicate a shift in CPEC strategy.

Prof Dr Agnieszka Kuszewska analysed in detail the crucial aspects of contemporary security dynamics with reference to Pakistan's foreign and domestic policy and shed light on the challenges and opportunities in this regard.

She was speaking at a seminar on Pakistan's contemporary challenges and opportunities in context of security dynamics organised by the Punjab University's Pakistan Study Centre on Thursday.

She is an expert on South Asia at the Institute of Middle and Far East of the Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.

PU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Niaz Ahmed, Pakistan Study Director Prof Dr Iqbal Chawla, faculty and students of several departments participated in the discussion.

Ms Kuszewska suggested that Pakistan should act as a smart power to balance relations between China and the United States. She signified the importance of cultural diplomacy which Pakistan should use for peaceful South Asia. 'Unfortunately, in the presence of Narendra Modi in the Indian government, the prospects for peace between Pakistan and India are quite depleted. The dream of regional integration and cooperation is also shattering,' she said.

Discussing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), she said Pakistan should be treated as a partner under the project and its underdeveloped areas like Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were going to get a major share of total benefits of the flagship project of One Belt, One Road initiative.

Pakistan Study Director Prof Dr Iqbal Chawla threw light on security dynamics of South Asia with special reference to relations between Pakistan and India.

He the security dilemma between Pakistan and India was a conspiracy hatched by the British, especially by Lord Mountbatten, adding that the Kashmir dispute had also its roots in British conspiracy and the dispute must be resolved under the light of the UN resolutions. He said that the perpetual contention between the two nuclear neighbors was haunting the security paradigm of the whole region.

The PU VC also spoke.

Minister for Finance Asad Umar on Tuesday said there was no financial crisis in the country as all economic indicators were improving and the financial gap for the current financial year (2018-19) had also been closed.

Speaking at the inaugural session of the 11th South Asia Economic Summit organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), he said that the current account deficit had decreased during the last three months from $2 billion per month to $1bn and the economic situation was far better now as compared to what it had been four to five months ago. Exports had started to increase and imports were decreasing, he explained.

'There is no need to create misconceptions about the economy, as this will hamper international investments and do no service to the country,' he added.

Talking about the recent hike in the dollar rate and rupee devaluation, Mr Umar said that the neutrality of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was intact: 'We believe in the autonomy of the institution,' he emphasised, 'and there is no change in government policy. The recent decision on the exchange rate was taken by the central bank. However, there is need to improve the communication mechanism, which is why the SBP governor has been taken on board. If needed, we will further institutionalise the structure and role of the SBP.'

The finance minister talked about the role of regional connectivity in poverty reduction, and said that intra-regional trade, especially trade between India and Pakistan, was one of the major growth drivers. Stressing the need to create political space for regional cooperation, he added that 'it is our inability that we failed to pull the people of the region out of poverty.'

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, former caretaker finance minister, also spoke at the event and said that regional connectivity was gaining momentum today, where the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative led by China could steer the effort for regional cooperation. She expressed the belief that OBOR had the potential to generate momentum to enhance regional partnership, which was currently in a state of deadlock between India and Pakistan in particular.

'The economy needs to progress on a set of new elements of requisite reforms, that include streamlining the tax system, improving the banking system, easing procedures to do business, improving competitiveness and promoting trade facilitation through trade regulation,' she noted.

Stressing that Pakistan and China could play an active role in regional cooperation and improved connectivity, she added that there exists the need to work on how development can contribute to peace efforts in the region. With reference to Pakistan-India relations, she asked India to follow the idea of 'Naya Pakistan' and go for 'Naya Hindustan'.

Dr Ratnakar Adhikari, executive director of the Enhanced Integrated Framework secretariat of the World Trade Organisation, Switzerland, said that it is important for South Asian countries to invest in research and development to capitalise upon the potential of the fourth industrial revolution. According to him, one of the major challenges faced by the region is the lack of skilled labour that can adapt to technology. For this, he said, there is need to build an enabling environment and improve regulatory systems to build trust.

Dr Nagesh Kumar, head of the United Nations' Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific's south and south-west office, New Delhi, noted that today South Asia is the fastest growing region in the world. However, he explained, we need to focus on development gaps such as poverty, gender inequality, the poor state of health, and education etc.

In turn, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, executive director of the SDPI, bolstered the gist of the discussion by saying that South Asian countries should set political differences aside for the sake of shared objectives. He expressed hope for improved regional cooperation, and referred to the opening of the Kartarpur corridor as a welcome step for peaceful co-existence. In this age of digitalisation and the internet, he added, despite their differences the people of both Pakistan and India are still connected.


 
 

'India doesn't have right to object to AJK's inclusion in CPEC'

India has no right to raise objections on the inclusion of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), said AJK President Masood Khan on Tuesday.

Addressing a seminar on CPEC and Regional Connectivity: Opportunities and Challenges, the president said: 'Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, Ladakh and the Kashmir Valley are different units of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an indivisible entity and has remained an important part of the ancient Silk Route for centuries.'

The president said the time is not far when Kashmir will again play a crucial role in regional cooperation, trade and business by becoming a gateway to CPEC.

'CPEC is a flagship project of China's Belt and Road Initiative which will connect three continents and will benefit 62pc of the world's population. Being a close and trusted friend of China, Pakistan will benefit largely from the project if we prepare ourselves to take the benefits of the project,' he said.

CPEC has heralded the end of military confrontation among countries in the region, harbouring a new era of regional cooperation in a range of fields including socio-economic development, business, trade and infrastructure development.

'The world is now changing in a way that has so far been unseen in scale and depth as new trading blocs are emerging by creating new economic geographies in order to accelerate economic activities across the globe,' he said.

He added that AJK is very much part of CPEC projects and that the region is executing four mega projects under CPEC. These include two mega hydropower generation projects in Karot and Kohala, the construction of the Mansehra-Mirpur Expressway and an industrial zone in Mirpur, he said.

Mr Khan urged universities of AJK to prepare their students so they can share the country's responsibilities in the future and stressed on raising awareness about CPEC and its benefits for the country.

Organised by the University of AJK, the seminar was also addressed by Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Kaleem Abbasi, Director of CPEC Centre of Excellence Dr Shahid Rashid, AJK Secretary for Tourism, Information and IT Midhat Shahzad and others.

Mr Abbasi highlighted the multi-dimensional opportunities, needs and challenges associated with CPEC and said Pakistan's strategic location gives it immense importance in the region.

City Mayor Wasim Akhtar said on Saturday that Pakistan's foreign policy was on the right track and relations with the neighbouring countries, especially China, held much importance as poverty could be eliminated by enhancing mutual trade.

'Karachi has become centre of attention after successfully hosting many international trade exhibitions and conferences, including Ideas and the world now look up to us for trade and investments,' he added.

The mayor expressed these views after formally opening the 14th Build Asia International Exhibition in the Karachi Expo Centre, which is being attended by 550 delegates from 27 countries, including China, Japan, Turkey and Iran.

He said that now the law and order situation in the country, especially Karachi, was satisfactory and the city had become centre of attention for the world.

Later speaking at a reception held in honour of participants in Build Asia Exhibition, the mayor said that China had always been a friend of Pakistan and the CPEC was one of the most prominent components of the Chinese President's vision of 'Belt and Road Initiative', commonly known as 'Yida Yilu' in the Chinese language.

'We will always look to enhance mutually beneficial cooperation with China,' he added.

Recalling his visit to China earlier this year, the mayor said that he had the opportunity to visit Shenyang City of Liaoning province where a 'Friendship City MoU' was signed with the Mayor of Shenyang.

Welcoming delegates from Liaoning Province, he said that he was confident that these follow-up visits would turn into something very fruitful for the benefit of the people. He said it was great to see this moment of opening up of a CCOIC Liaoning Chamber Economic and Trade Representative Office in Karachi which was the economic hub of the country.

'I always in my personal as well as official capacity have been trying to help businessmen to conduct trade activities in a better manner as it is the basis of a prosperous society,' he said.

He said that several projects were already under way in cooperation with Chinese companies and 'we look forward to future'.

Mr Akhtar said: 'We are looking to explore opportunities in various sectors, including improvement of infrastructure, development of parks and horticulture, improvement of major roads, footpaths and bridges, commercial parking plazas, lighting arrangement of major roads, construction of new fire stations, improvements of flyovers, underpasses and bridges, development of amusement parks, cleaning of storm-water drains, technical education, transport and information technology.'

He said that more than 200 companies from China were already participating in the ongoing Build Asia International Exhibition in Karachi Expo Centre which would open up many possibilities of joint venture, investments, transfer of technology and trade activities.


 
 

Reliance on Chinese funding to grow: Fitch

The government's reliance on China will only grow in the coming years as private sector investment continues to decline in the country despite improvements in security conditions, rise in power production and better infrastructure, said Fitch Solutions in a report released on Wednesday.

'The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will continue to play an important role in driving infrastructure growth in developing economies in Asia,' highlights the report.

Pakistan has failed to attract private sector investment despite better security conditions, increasing power capacity and strengthening infrastructure. The lack of investment from other countries will only increase the country's reliance on Chinese BRI.

The BRI-related funding comes with its own political risks. The report points out that 'the rise in the number of populist candidates around the world has increased the risk of major infrastructure policy shift in countries with upcoming elections.' In a worrying trend around Asia, 'National governments embracing Chinese investment and taking on Chinese government loans has led to the opposition parties using it as an attractive campaigning tool to rally the electorate.'

However, despite underlying risks, Fitch expects 'a continued reliance on Beijing and the BRI for the financing and construction of infrastructure projects, regardless of who is in power.'

BRI projects have been criticised for the over-reliance on Chinese labour and equipment at the cost of local population where construction sites are located. But, 'with the passage of time, as technology is transferred and the required framework for the development of complex infrastructure projects have been set up, we expect the involvement of more local companies in BRI projects, shifting the competitive landscape from Chinese-dominated to a joint-partnership model', adds the report.

Furthermore, 269 students received MS/MPhil degrees and three PhDs.

The governor said the government was focusing on the promotion of education and the universities should formulate research-oriented studies to play their role for the development of the country. He said the students who were receiving their degrees should also play their role and share their knowledge with the people of the country because there were millions of children who did not have access to education.

Prof Wang Junzhe congratulated the students on completing their study. 'Pak-China friendship is 67 years old and this friendship is based on the principle of trust and peaceful existence,' he said.

He said CPEC under One Belt One Road had opened new doors of opportunities of employment and development for the people of both countries. 'The project is not only beneficial for Pakistan and China but it would open connectivity to the Middle East, South, North, Europe and other regions too.'

He also said both countries should play their role in promoting cultural ties and their university had opened their doors for the students from all over the world. UCP Pro Rector Prof Dr Muhammad Zafarullah said the two institutions would work together in the field of education and would exchange faculty, staff, students, training and joint research activities besides exchange of academic material.


 
 

The Kosygin Plan

NEARLY 50 years ago, Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin floated in Pakistan what came to be known as the Kosygin Plan. He said in May 1969 'the Soviet Union would like to see Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and other states of this region developing mutual relations of friendship and constructive cooperation. The Soviet Union will do its utmost to facilitate this'.

None were taken in, for the core of the plan was known to Pakistani and Indian leaders. It envisaged road-building to promote regional cooperation; an overland trade route running from the Soviet Union to India through Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The reasons for its failure are relevant half a century later, when road-building has acquired greater importance in this region. It was first proposed by Kosygin tentatively at Tashkent in 1966 to president Ayub Khan and prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and was renewed to all the three countries in 1969. Kosygin made the proposal to prime minister Indira Gandhi on May 5, 1979; to Afghanistan later that month; and to president Yahya Khan when he arrived in Pakistan. It was to be part of an Asian highway running through a dozen countries.

Recent ventures in road-building require a mature approach.

Pakistan's instant reaction was negative. On July 10, the Foreign Office spokesman said 'the proposal has little economic advantage for Pakistan'. He hit the nail on the head with resounding effect: 'The Russians are now so exercised over their conflict with China that they will go to any length to isolate it from their neighbours.'

It was a hard decision for Pakistan. For, to India's chagrin, Pakistan had received from the Soviet Union 100 TU-54 tanks in addition to 50 delivered as the first instalment. Kosygin envisaged a conference in Kabul in which Pakistan, India, Iran, Turkey, Nepal, the host Afghanistan and the sponsor, USSR, would participate.

The lid over this seemingly innocuous idea was blown in June 1969 by Soviet president Leonid Brezhnev when he publicly proposed 'a system of collective security in Asia'. Clearly, the Kosygin Plan for regional cooperation and road-building was part of the Brezhnev Plan for Asian security and both were aimed at isolating China.

Even after the Indo-Soviet Treaty (1971) Indira Gandhi rejected the Brezhnev Plan when he came to India. Both plans fell, leaving an important lesson on the nexus between road-building and politics. Narrow political interests of any side will spell the defeat of its plans for connectivity. It would be as short-sighted to allow narrow political interests to override the demands of connectivity.

Mahnaz Z. Ispahani has brilliantly analysed both factors in Roads and Rivals: The Politics of Access in the Border Lands of Asia. She demonstrates the havoc which the tunnel vision of the Great Powers can wreak. For instance, 'neither the Afghan government nor the Soviet Union was overly attentive to the construction of small but important roads connecting rural areas with urban centres and with one another. Given its complex, fragmented terrain and its dispersed population, Afghanistan required numerous cheap, low-volume roads. For similar reasons, these roads were costly to construct. Highways ... were even costlier. The efforts of both the Soviet Union and the United States gave Afghanistan an excellent national highway system, but the country remained devoid of minor routes. What few rural roads were constructed were below standard, and certain towns and areas ... were not even connected to the main trunk routes'.

Dr Ispahani points out that 'in the developing world, where colonial rule has been and gone, leaving a legacy of arbitrary territorial division and a physical infrastructure tailored to imperial rivalries rather than local economic and political needs, where diverse peoples and forms of social organisation have been bound together, with few resources, little technology, and on terrain that militates against movement, the story of routes and anti-routes can map the ways in which states trade off their interests in power and in progress, and can trace the course of the rivalries and partnership that shape a region's geopolitics'.

Recent ventures in road-building require a mature approach by all the sponsor and participants alike. China's Belt and Road Initiative has received less study than it deserves. India-Pakistan differences cast their shadow on such projects, especially with a Modi government in power.

Few in India note the possibilities of building on the success of the accord with Pakistan in the Kartarpur corridor for Sikh pilgrims, from Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur in Pakistan to Dera Baba Nanak's shrine in India's Gurdaspur district.

This agreement should provoke some thinking on two matters 'religious tourism' across the India-Pakistan boundary and releasing Kashmir from the imprisonment which its closed ancient routes entail.


 
 

Foreign policy agenda 2019

UNLIKE its daunting domestic objectives, Pakistan's external agenda, though challenging, is fairly clear. And, although overstretched, Islama­bad has the capacity in its Foreign Service and the 'security establishment' to address this agenda.

Building the Pakistan-China strategic partnership: China has the strategic motivation and financial, technological and weapons capabilities to help Pakistan emerge as a militarily strong and economically dynamic state. The substance and depth of the future strategic partnership will depend mainly on the ability of the Pakistan government and its private sector to conceive and execute cooperative projects and ventures with China. A special entity dedicated to timely and efficient implementation of CPEC could be decisive in realising its full potential.

Managing Sino-US rivalry: The Trump administration has designated China as a strategic competitor and opposes China's Belt and Road Initiative including its flagship, CPEC. The US diplomatic and media onslaught against China and CPEC has intensified. In fact, China's investment and infrastructure building can help stabilise the entire South Asian region including Afghanistan. With growing indications that Donald Trump wants a hurried withdrawal from Afghanistan, agreement on the role China can and should play in stabilising the region must become a priority for Pakistan's regional diplomacy.

Pakistan should revive its traditional leadership role in the Muslim world.

Afghanistan: Pakistan and US positions appeared to converge recently as the US belatedly accepted the need for a political settlement in Afghanistan and opened direct talks with the Afghan Taliban which Pakistan facilitated. However, the entire negotiating process, including the one initiated by US Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, may be thrown in disarray by Trump's announcement to withdraw 7,000 US troops from Afghanistan. Sensing US abandonment, and under unrelenting Taliban pressure, the Kabul 'unity' government, even the Afghan National Army, may collapse, reviving the likelihood of another prolonged civil war.

Read: First Pak-aided US-Taliban talks held in UAE

Pakistan's diplomacy must work simultaneously with the US and China, Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia to prevent civil war and promote a viable political settlement in Afghanistan. A conference involving these states and major Afghan parties could be convened to draw up the broad parameters of such a settlement.

Pakistan-US: In Trump's 'America First' environment, there is a growing 'Washington Consensus' against China, Russia and the Muslim world, including compliant 'allies'. The US has been reluctant to acknowledge Pakistan's cooperation on Afghanistan and continued to adopt punitive measures against it. If the US leaves Afghanistan without a political settlement, it may feel free to take further action against Pakistan. Islamabad needs to negotiate the structure of its future ties with the US in tandem with arrangements for US troops' withdrawal from Afghanistan. After America's exit, Pakistan's leverage will be diminished.

Kashmir and India: It is evident that Imran Khan, the PTI government and Pakistan's army chief desire normalisation with India. This sentiment is not reciprocated, although Pakistan's unilateral gesture of opening the Kartarpur corridor put New Delhi temporarily on the defensive. In the run-up to the 2019 Indian elections, the Modi government may seek to revive its flagging political fortunes by generating hostility against Pakistan, or even 'limited' military action, on some cooked-up pretext. Pakistan must remain vigilant and defeat any aggressive move.

Normalisation with India is highly unlikely so long as it continues its oppression in occupied Kashmir and refuses to resume a comprehensive dialogue with Pakistan. To defend Kashmiris' fundamental rights, Pakistan must launch an international diplomatic and media campaign to project and condemn India's human rights violations in occupied Kashmir (confirmed and documented in the recent report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights).

Terrorism: India's campaign to portray Pakistan as a sponsor of 'terrorism' is designed to constrict Islamabad's ability to advance its national security and economic development goals. Fortunately, this campaign, although supported by the US, has failed so far. Pakistan must kill it. To this end, it could: 1) fulfil its obligations under relevant UNSC resolutions (placing required restraints on designated entities and persons); 2) insist on elimination of the BLA and TTP presence from Afghanistan in the context of an Afghan political settlement, and 3) launch a diplomatic and media campaign to project India's state-sponsored terrorism in Kashmir and from Afghanistan and elsewhere.

Saudi Arabia and Iran: The government has, by force of circumstance, revived Pakistan's close relationship with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Their financial support is essential at present to keep the economy afloat. The future commercial viability of Gwadar (and CPEC) depends to a considerable extent on its emergence as the oil and gas transshipment centre and a petrochemical complex. This will become feasible if Saudi Arabia and its GCC allies route a part of their oil, gas and refined product exports through Gwadar to China.

Pakistan should resist the urge to mediate between Riyadh and Tehran, at least for now. Pakistan's ties with Iran are vital and Saudi-Iranian reconciliation is essential for regional peace and stability. However, the US and Israel are likely to subvert mediatory efforts. Riyadh is vulnerable to US pressure at this time. Pakistan still has issues to resolve with Iran including the reported presence of RAW operatives on its soil and cross-border incidents eg the recent attack on the FC patrol.

Economic diplomacy: Pakistan's diplomats and embassies should play a larger role in promoting trade and investment. But Pakistan must first be able to produce goods and services it can export and create the economic environment conducive for foreign investment.

Islamic world: Pakistan should revive its traditional leadership role in the Muslim world which confronts multiple challenges. An initiative to provide humanitarian support to Muslims in occupied territories and war zones could be a worthy initiative.

Global challenges: Nor should Pakistan discard its traditional leadership role at the UN and other international fora. Although by population Pakistan is the sixth largest country, it has been excluded from most groupings of the powerful G20, BRICS, APEC, etc. Yet, by this very token, Pakistan is well placed to lead the vast majority of developing countries, which have also been excluded from these 'elite' groups, and ensure their voices are heard on global issues like climate change, development and disarmament.


 
 

 China  backs Pakistan's efforts for Afghan peace

China on Tuesday expressed its support for latest developments in efforts for revival of Afghan peace and reconciliation process.

Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi is currently on a regional tour of four countries - Afghanistan, Iran, China and Russia - to apprise leaders of these countries about the meeting between the United States and the Taliban in Abu Dhabi last week, which was facilitated by Pakistan.

He met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at Beijing in the third leg of his visit.

'FM Shah Mehmood Qureshi, on his tour to regional countries, has held discussions with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Bilateral and regional issues, especially peace in Afghanistan, were discussed,' FO spokesman Dr Mohammad Faisal said.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said that Mr Qureshi, who made 'a special trip' here, in his meeting with Mr Wang discussed 'the latest developments surrounding the situation in Afghanistan' and the two sides reached 'broad consensus'.

Qureshi, Wang reach 'broad consensus' at their meeting in Beijing

She said that 'miscellaneous efforts' made by different parties were 'welcomed' and the two sides pledged to stay 'in close communication and strategic coordination'.

China, Pakistan and Afghanistan have trilateral framework for enhancing their cooperation on peace and reconciliation, security, connectivity and in other areas.

The second meeting of the trilateral process was held in Kabul on Dec 15 in which the three sides signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for intensifying their counterterrorism cooperation.

Ms Hua further said that Mr Qureshi and Mr Wang in their meeting agreed to deepen China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and continuously elevate all-round cooperation.

Mr Qureshi will meet his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Wednesday.

The US decision to pull nearly half of its troops from restive Afghanistan was high on the agenda at the meeting between the Pakistani and Chinese foreign ministers, add agencies.

'The two sides agreed that a military means cannot solve the Afghan issue, and that promoting a political solution focused on reconciliation is the only realistic and feasible way,' the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said.

President Donald Trump's decision to pull around half of the 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan has stunned and dismayed diplomats and officials in Kabul, and comes during a renewed push for talks with the Taliban to end the 17-year war.

China has not announced an official stance on the US troop pullout, but Pakistan on Saturday welcomed the decision to slash US troop numbers calling it 'a step towards peace' in war-torn Afghanistan.

In recent months, China has played a more active role in brokering peace in the region as stability in Afghanistan is critical to its Belt and Road policy of expanding trade links across Asia.

Beijing has hosted Taliban leaders in an effort to bring the warring sides in Afghanistan to the negotiating table.

It has been long worried about the effect of instability in Afghanistan on China's violence-prone far western region of Xinjiang, home to the mostly Muslim Uighur people and where China says it faces a threat from militants.

The China Power Hub Generation Company (CPHGC) has successfully synchronised one of its two 660MW coal-fired power plants with the national grid, the company announced on Monday.

The synchronisation of the first unit was achieved ahead of schedule and was realised within the agreed technical parameters, said the company release. After the commencement of commercial operations at CPHGC, the project will add 9 billion kWh of electricity of the national grid every year meeting electricity needs of 4 million households in the country.

The project will run on imported coal and will operate with super-critical technology at a total installed capacity of 1,320MW. The company also announced that it plans to complete the second 660MW unit within the stipulated time and synchronisation would be completed by Aug 2019.

While announcing the completion of project, CPHGC Chief Executive Zhao Yonggang appreciated the team work and efforts by Pakistani and Chinese employees to complete the project before time.

Mr Yonggang said that the 2x660MW plant is a priority project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the first overseas thermal power project developed by State Power Investment Corporation under the China's Belt and Road Initiative.

The CPHGC project, loca­ted in Hub, Balochistan, is a joint venture between China-Pakistan Inter­na­tional Holding a state owned entity and the Hub Power Company Ltd (Hubco) with 74 per cent and 26pc ownership respectively.

Recently, Hubco announced that it plans to increase its shareholding the project from 26pc to 47.5pc through its wholly owned subsidiary, Hubco Power Holdings. However, the transaction will be consummated after regulatory and corporate approvals from China and Pakistan.

The letter of support for the project was issued in 2016 which includes a power plant and a dedicated coal jetty.

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday invited Turkish businessmen and investors to invest in various fields and industries in Pakistan, including construction, tourism and exploration of natural resources.

Addressing the Turkish business fraternity at the Trkiye Odalar ve Borsalar Birligi in Ankara, the prime minister said the Belt and Road Initiative of China would bridge communication gap between Pakistan and Turkey and help increase trade between the two countries.

Prime Minister Khan, accompanied by his economic team, is on his first official two-day visit to Turkey.

In his late-night address, the prime minister said that trade between Pakistan and Turkey remained quite low in the past and they could not get benefit of trade due to lack of road and rail routes.

He said that with a population of 210 million people, including 120m below the age of 35 years, Pakistan was a big market for foreign investors.

Prime Minister Khan said that Pakistan had ample tourism attraction due to its fascinating hilly ranges, plains, sea and rivers. 'Out of 12 highest peaks in the world, half of them are in Pakistan,' he added.

He said that his government had streamlined the governance system and removed red-tapism and hurdles in Pakistan to facilitate foreign investors. 'We want to provide ease of doing business to the businessmen and investors for wealth and jobs creation,' he said.

The prime minister invited Turkish investors and construction firms to invest in his government's five-year plan of building five million houses.

Earlier, the prime minister and his delegation arrived in Konya.

To pay homage to Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi, the prime minister and his delegation visited the great Sufi saint's mausoleum. He also visited the symbolic grave of Allama Iqbal located in the graveyard where Maulana Rumi's mau­soleum stands.

The prime minister was accompanied by Minister for Foreign Affairs Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Finance Minister Asad Umar, Minister for Plan­ning, Development and Reforms Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtyar, Adviser to the PM on Commerce, Textile, Industry and Production Razak Dawood and Special Assistant to the PM on Overseas Pakistanis Zulfikar Abbas Bukhari.

During the visit, the prime minister will also meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

It is expected that the prime minister's visit to Turkey will bring some respite in the prevailing economic crunch in Pakistan as some memoranda of understanding on trade and investment are likely to be inked between the two sides.

China plans to import potatoes from Pakistan, said Ambassador Yao Jing on Friday.

The envoy in a meeting with Minister for National Food Security and Research Sahibzada Mehboob Sultan said his country will shortly send a delegation to Islamabad to finalise arrangements and fulfilling the requirements sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS).

He said that Beijing wants to import more from Pakistan, especially food items are cherries, potato, wheat, citrus, rice and mangoes. China wants to build stronger socio-economic ties with Pakistan on the basis of reciprocity, he added.

Pakistan's annual potato yield currently stands at around 4.2 million tonnes as against domestic requirement is 3.75m tonnes - leaving a sizable surplus. About 97 per cent of the vegetable is grown in Punjab while the rest in other provinces.

The fresh crop of potato, which hit the local market in early December 2018, will be ready for export by the end of January prior to the visit of Chinese delegation.

The country has already taken steps to promote the export of cotton for which a facilitation centre for exporters is already operational in Okara.

The envoy informed Sultan that hybrid rice seed experts from Pakistan will soon be invited to see and monitor the facilities in China.

The minister told Jing that the Pakistani government will soon make a decision on the import of Chinese hybrid rice seed.

Over the recent past, 29 rice hybrids were received from the Hubei Provincial Seed Group of China by Pakistan Agriculture Research Council, and tested at the Rice Research Institute at Dokri, Larkana. Eight of them were found promising with paddy yield of more than 100 maunds per acre.

At the institute, various local varieties were being converted for the development of indigenous rice hybrids. The Rice Research Programme has so far acquired more than 22,500 lines from the International Rice Research Institute in Philippines which are high-yielding with desirable grain quality.

The establishment of foot and mouth disease (FMD) free zone in Pakistan was also discussed and Sultan invited Chinese experts to visit three districts of Punjab which have been identified as FMD-free.

The minister informed the envoy that the first meeting of the joint working group created to implement the memorandum of understanding signed during Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to China in November will take place in Islamabad next month to explore areas of cooperation between the two countries in agricultural sector.

Chinese assistance to set up the FMD vaccine plant in Pakistan will be among the agenda of the group's meeting, the minister said.

Jing informed Sultan that Chinese companies are interested to come to Pakistan and set up special economic zones with agriculture being one of the six major areas identified by Chinese government.

Sultan told the envoy that the two countries could identify and start working on areas of mutual benefit in the field of agriculture prior to the 'Belt and Road Conference' scheduled to open on April 27 in China.

Speakers at a session at ThinkFest on Saturday said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) should not be beneficial for Pakistan alone but other countries too should be the beneficiary of such a mega scheme an important part of the Belt and Road initiative.

'The CPEC is politically, economically and strategically important for China in particular as it will succeed in avoiding a very long route to reach the Gulf States through eastern and western routes in Pakistan, providing opportunities to Afghanistan, Iran, India and other countries,' said Khalid Butt of the GC University.

He said Pakistan, which had failed to become an agricultural or industrial country, was now passing through the servicing model like Singapore and other states.

'Let's see how we make progress in the service sector now since we have already experienced the agricultural and industrial based economy that couldn't succeed,' he added.

The session titled 'CPEC and its Global Context' was moderated by Ms Maria Sultan, SASSI university director general. The session was followed by a question and answer hour allocated for the general public.

'I would love to see Pakistan as a manufacturing country. But it doesn't seem possible since we are heading towards a servicing country like Singapore and Malaysia. We cannot become a manufacturing country since we don't have technology, adequate electricity, skills etc,' Mr Butt said while responding to a question.

He urged the government to complete the CPEC western route at a fast pace besides establishing special economic zones. 'It will increase foreign investment in the country,' he said.


 
 

A Chinese 're-education'

IN an interview with a Turkish television channel, Prime Minister Imran Khan completely sidestepped a question about the condition of Uighur Muslims in China's western Xinjiang province. He admitted that he knew little about the issue, and, instead, preferred to focus on and highlight Chinese financial assistance and investment in Pakistan.

China is under stiff criticism for its alleged persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, especially Uighur Muslims. Freedom House's 2018 country report on China classified it as 'religiously-not-free' on its freedom index. China is seriously concerned about this growing perception that hurts its efforts to promote a 'soft image' of China for a successful execution of its Belt and Road Initiative and other global commercial and strategic projects. Last week, China said that it welcomed UN officials to visit Xinjiang provided that they stay out of its internal affairs.

Pakistan usually avoids commenting on China's internal affairs. But many Pakistani men, married to Chinese Uighur women, claim their spouses are being held in so-called re-education camps and are demanding their release. The issue has put Pakistan in a difficult position, mainly due to China's huge investment in the country, as well as the extreme sensitivity of Chinese authorities to discussions on the subject.

Mystery continues to shroud the nature of the camps in Xinjiang.

Mystery continues to shroud China's re-education camps, with authorities least interested in opening them up to independent observers. However, Chinese scholars claim that they are a part of the country's countering violent extremism strategy, which was not built in isolation from rest of the world. They assert that China has designed its re-education strategy after carefully examining CVE approaches in practice in the West and Muslim world, which also employ similar community engagement programmes. Though they tend to justify their muscular approach by quoting examples from the Gulf, and South and Southeast Asian Muslim nations, the Chinese CVE strategy still appears highly politicised and opaque to Western practitioners and policymakers.

Much of the information about China's re-education centres comes from West. Though the criticism has forced Chinese authorities to 'release' some information, it is insufficient to make a proper assessment. Last year, a state-run news agency published an interview of Shohrat Zakir, the Xinjiang governor, describing the camps as 'professional vocational training institutions' for people influenced by terrorism and extremism who have not committed an offence warranting criminal punishment.

Similarly, in a seminar in China last November, local scholars explained China's CVE approaches. Alluding to diverse and disparate CVE practices in different countries, they tended to conclude that no uniform or global CVE programme exists. One Chinese scholar presented a four-layered model based on the four principles of breaking, establishing, preventing and developing. 'Breaking' referred to isolating individuals from an extremist environment; 'establishing' meant introducing them to the true spiritual values of religion; 'preventing' was seen as educating; and 'developing' was interpreted as a skill development programme.

However, one of the best works available on the subject of China's CVE strategy is by Zunyou Zhou, a Germany-based Chinese scholar. In a paper published in the Journal of Terrorism and Political Violence in 2017, he noted that the Chinese CVE strategy is based on multiple approaches and, interestingly, that they consulted Western CVE and deradicalisation approaches extensively and then built their own, more muscular model. The approaches include 'five keys', 'four prongs', 'three contingents', 'two hands' and 'one rule'. Viewed together, these approaches point to legal, religious, cultural, ideological, and scientific aspects of the deradicalisation effort, implemented by governmental agencies, public institutions and non-governmental organisations in the region.

The Xinjiang government has developed several programmes to target different groups of people, including those who are 'radicalised' as well as those who are not but considered vulnerable to recruitment. The 'five keys' ideological, cultural, customary, religious and legal give a long-sustaining solution to terrorism. The 'four prongs' refer to a combination of four methods: 'squeezing by correct faith'; 'counteracting by culture'; 'controlling by law'; and 'popularising science'. 'Squeezing by correct faith' refers to clarifying people's understanding of Islam while 'counteracting by culture' means seeking effective and practical solutions to thwart extremism and guiding people towards secularisation and modernisation. The 'three contingents' refer to the policy of reinforcing three main groups of people the government can count on to maintain stability and security. The 'two hands' refer to the one 'firm hand' that cracks down on terrorists, and the other 'firm hand' that educates and guides Uighur people, and the 'one rule' means the policy of ruling Xinjiang according to the law.

The author also provides historical background on the evolution of the Chinese CVE strategy and mentions that it materialised in a policy document entitled Several Guiding Opinions on Further Suppressing Illegal Religious Activities and Combating the Infiltration of Religious Extremism in Accordance with Law, issued by Xinjiang's CCP Committee in May 2013. The policy document was also referred to as 'No. 11 Document', and described the borders between ethnic customs, normal religious practices and extremist manifestations.

For the CVE strategy's smooth implementation, the Xinjiang authorities have introduced new legal regimes, and the latest amendment (titled 'Regulation on Anti-Extremism') was introduced in April 2017 to ban a wide range of extremist behaviours. Under the new legal framework, authorities have launched many programmes including deradicalisation for prisoners, and social programmes for those who have engaged in terrorism or extremism but do not deserve criminal punishment.

The re-education camps or 'rehabilitation centres' have been created as a part of China's social programming. These centres run through civil society groups in Xinjiang or through 'Fang Hui Ju' working groups, dispatched by the regional government, comprising practitioners tasked with winning the hearts and minds of the people.

For CVE practitioners, the Chinese model may have a lot of substance to learn from. But the Uighur problem is more complex than religious extremism, as it has added dimensions of ethnic, cultural and political rights. For Pakistan, the Chinese CVE model offers nothing to learn from except to find a way of resolving the issue of Pakistani citizens' spouses held in these camps.


 
 

 China  to pick Afghan Taliban as political force: envoy

Chinese Ambas­sador in Islamabad Yao Jing has said that his country will 'pick Afghan Taliban as a political force' in the backdrop of their participation in the ongoing peace talks with the US and at other forums.

Speaking at a roundtable conference at the Area Study Centre, University of Peshawar, on Tuesday, he said that Beijing supported Pakistan's fresh initiatives for facilitating efforts for political settlement of the Afghan conflict and confidence-building measures in relations with Kabul.

Asked about apparent lack of eagerness on the part of China in the ongoing talks for political settlement of the Afghan issue, the envoy said that his country had contacts with both the Taliban and the Afghan government. China had deputed a special envoy who was visiting the Taliban's political office in Doha, he added.

'China will pick them (Taliban) as a political force because they are now part of the Afghan political process and they have some political concerns. They have to be allowed to play a legitimate role in the future political settlement,' he further elaborated his government's policy on the Afghan peace process being discussed at different forums.

Pakistan's initiative for facilitating Afghan peace process supported

'If possible, China can exert pressure on the Taliban to join the peace process,' said the ambassador who had served in Kabul and New Delhi before taking over his new assignment in Pakistan. He urged all external stakeholders, including Afghanistan's neighbours, to play their role for peace in the war-ravaged country.

'Afghans have been suffering for the last 40 years and they deserve peace and stability,' he said.

Supporting Pakistan's fresh initiatives for facilitating talks between the Taliban and US administration, he said that China backed this ongoing process and had also played its role in the Moscow meeting and at other forums.

Mr Yao said that Afghans were very friendly towards China which had close relations with their country. 'When we look towards west, the immediate challenge for us is Afghanistan having many international terrorist organisations.'

He said that Central Asian states had their own version and vision about Afghanistan and the same was the case of Russia, Iran and Pakistan.

'We are very much hopeful about a peaceful settlement of the Afghan issue, but this is a very complicated issue, which requires a lot of patience,' the envoy said. The US might announce withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan where elections were around the corner, he added.

Clarifying his country's stance about the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), particularly the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he accused western media of spreading negative propaganda against the project. He dispelled the impression that China wanted to establish its economic hegemony in the region through the BRI and the CPEC.

'Why would China want to control Pakistan through the CPEC and why would we spend money to control Pakistan? China could not control Pakistan in the 1960s when you (Pakistan) were in a more difficult position. At that time both countries had good relations,' he said, emphasising that Beijing's foreign policy was never based on influencing or controlling other countries. He said that China had developed a new concept of foreign policy based on the BRI.

'You should understand China first, instead of judging [it] from the western propaganda. Please talk to us, understand China's intentions and let us focus on peace and stability in Afghanistan,' he said.

Mr Yao said that the CPEC was purely an economic project, but regional rivalries, militancy and relations among the regional countries could affect the project. He said that India had its own assessment and understanding about the economic corridor. He said that China had very close relations with Pakistan and the CPEC was part of its own development strategy.

The ambassador said that the Gwadar port was presently a 'losing' project and the Chinese company which took over it in 2011 was paying $14 million subsidy annually. He said that Pakistan had handed over the port to a Singaporean company in 2008 which had brought only one second-hand crane there.

He said that the CPEC did not encompass the whole relations between the two countries but it was only one part of the bilateral ties. He said that China had been supporting Islamabad at regional and international forums and had started trilateral cooperation comprising Pakistan, Afghanistan and China. The CPEC would play a major role in this regard, he added.

Worried over the prevailing insecurity in the region, the envoy said that the BRI could become a victim of regional instability, insecurity or even state-to-state relations.

FOREIGN policy is the external aspect of national policy. It covers the whole gamut of global, regional and neighbourhood developments, movements and strategies.

When national policy is substandard it puts a ceiling on the success of foreign policy no matter how good it is.

Take a look: What are the foreign policy challenges faced by 'Naya Pakistan'

Similarly, given the external dependency of Pakistan's national policy, it cannot achieve its goals without a prioritised and resourced foreign policy.

Some aspects of external policy are primarily dealt with by specialised ministries, departments and services.

But the Foreign Office should not be held responsible for the negative consequences of bad decisions it had no part in taking. This often happens and is always at the cost of the national interest.

This is obvious. Yet in practice it is usually ignored. Why? The main reason is the unwillingness of corrupt or weak governments to take any risks for good governance, including good foreign policy.

This is the soft state syndrome. It is often a prelude to a failing state. It precludes serving the national interest. Powerful vested interests define the national interest and make foreign policy. What is to be done?

If the political system is made participatory and inclusive it will eventually find the right answers. If it remains elitist, exclusive and exploitative it will not. Changing the system, however, involves risk-taking.

Pakistan has 10 major external relationships. Primarily: India, China, the US, and Afghanistan; and significantly: Iran, the GCC countries, Russia, the European Union (which still includes the UK,) the Central Asian states, and the UN.

Also read: Pakistan should strengthen ties with neighbours instead of US, says Hina Rabbani Khar

India is Pakistan's major adversary. China is Pakistan's only strategic partner. The US is still the world's mightiest and only comprehensive global power. Afghanistan is a force multiplier for Pakistan's security or insecurity. Iran confronts Pakistan with critical choices.

Powerful vested interests define the national interest and make foreign policy. What is to be done?

The GCC countries are a major source of remittances and 'brotherly' assistance which almost always entails an embarrassing price.

Russia in partnership with China is a significant counterforce to the US and its alliance with India. Moreover, it has the potential to bring about a less imbalanced Russian policy towards India and Pakistan.

The EU is a major market and the Pakistani community in the UK (and the US) can be a foreign policy asset.

Central Asia can provide 'strategic depth' to Pakistan's connectivity-based diplomacy. Improving cooperation with Russia can help here also.

The UN may seem irrelevant. It is not. It is where a country's image, profile and voice are confirmed and contested. It is the forum in which the credibility of a foreign policy is measured. Its agencies, funds and organisations can be important knowledge-intensive and problem-solving assets.

Due to space limitations only Pakistan's four 'primary' relationships will be very briefly commented on.

India: The core issues for Pakistan are progress towards a Kashmir settlement acceptable to opinion in the Valley and radically improving the horrendous human rights situation there. For India it is Pakistan's use of 'terrorist proxies'.

These core issues need to be addressed to the satisfaction of each other if dialogue is to be meaningful. Finding common ground for a negotiating process to be sustainable is a challenge.

Indian interference in Balochistan is a fact. However, the Balochistan 'problem' is not of India's making. It is due to institutionalised bad governance and exploitation over decades.

Pakistan should continue to extend its hand of cooperation irrespective of a lack of response from India. It should keep the LoC quiet as best it can. It should build on the Kartarpur initiative. It should extend normal trading or MFN rights as promised. This is arguably a WTO obligation also.

Pakistan should offer travel, communications, confidence and security-building (including regular nuclear and water-management) discussions and proposals. Let India take its time to respond. Pakis­tan cannot lose by being consistent and reasonable.

Realistic rather than provocative narratives need to be developed. The people of both countries need to get to know each other more directly instead of through warped images.

Differences need to be contained, addressed and reduced through a realistic working relationship. This will enable South Asia to meet the survival challenges of the 21st century.

The leaders of both countries should make appropriate statements, stay in touch, and unfold a range of innovative initiatives. If India demurs, even after its elections, that is its problem.

China: The BRI and CPEC are golden opportunities for Pakistan. But they are not magic wands. Moreover, no other country is willing to invest on such a scale in Pakistan.

Pakistan needs to look after its own interests without making disconcerting public statements. It needs to assure the Chinese that it is a reliable economic and strategic partner.

Explore: The China agenda

Chinese concerns are growing. They need to be addressed. Chinese and Pakistani 'dreams' need to be integrated into a shared vision through mutually reinforcing policies. The BRI is the context for CPEC. Similarly, CPEC is the context for the transformation of Pakistan. Sensitive issues can be dealt with confidentially, judiciously and on the basis of complete mutual trust.

The US: It is a strategic ally of India. India is focused on Pakistan. The US is focused on China. America cannot be a strategic partner for Pakistan. But its friendship is beneficial while its hostility is harmful. Pakistan must work with the US for an Afghan settlement, in consultation with China.

'Do not want Pakistan treated like a hired gun': PM Khan on US ties

Afghanistan: Pakistan cannot eliminate India from an Afghan settlement process. Nor should it try to. If Pakistan plays its cards right it will always have a stronger hand than India in Afghanistan. The Afghan Taliban despite their current military successes are not the future of Afghanistan. Unless they cooperate for a settlement they cannot become a 21st-century asset for Pakistan.

Explore: Balancing ties

India is justly regarded as a large neighbour with a small heart. Many Afghans see Pakistan similarly despite the massive Afghan goodwill accumulated during the Soviet occupation. Why?

Pakistan need not create a two-front situation for itself. Being large-hearted towards a smaller neighbour is actually good strategy. Specific issues are more easily resolved when the fundamentals are okay.

THE 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the 2015 UN Summit constitute the most ambitious development agenda approved by the international community. Implementation of these goals will require simultaneous achievement of economic growth, social inclusion and environmental sustainability.

Their implementation depends on: adequate incorporation of the SDGs in national development plans, programmes and projects; access to capital required to finance these; and the capacity national and international to implement the plans, programmes and projects.

The greatest challenge is the deployment of adequate financing for implementation of the SDGs. It will require an additional public and private investment of $3 trillion annually in low-carbon energy, agriculture, health, education and other sustainability sectors.

There is a solid economic rationale to prioritise global investment in developing countries.

At least 70 per cent of the additional investment should be in the developing countries. There is a solid economic rationale to prioritise global investment in developing countries, especially since return on investment in developing countries is double and triple that in 'investment-saturated' advanced economies.

This investment volume of $3tr is not so daunting when compared to the size of the global GDP ($120tr and growing at 3pc); the world's stock of financial assets ($300tr, growing at 5pc annually); and available finance (an estimated $10tr locked into negative yielding sovereign debt).

As the 2016 report of the Business and Sustainable Development Commission has noted: 'There is no single type of investment (more essential) for the achievement of the SDGs than infrastructure', which includes all major energy, transport, telecoms, land use, water, and waste investments. Long-term and sustainable growth requires targeted investment in physical, human and social infrastructure.

Such sustainable infrastructure investment is key to the structural transformation needed to meet the core criteria for SDG achievement: growth, social inclusion and low carbon outcomes. It will also revive growth in the global economy.

The generation of sustainable infrastructure investment will require long-term national, regional and global planning and vision. It will be essential to mobilise the right investors (ie those able to invest at scale in infrastructure projects); deploy new technologies (to reduce costs and ensure sustainable structural transformation); and align new infrastructure with the goal of limiting global warming.

It will also require an overhaul of the world's infrastructure financing mechanisms. There is a huge deficit in current infrastructure financing. The US and EU invest around 2pc of GDP annually in infrastructure. The developing countries invest much less. They need to put in 6pc to 8 pc of GDP into infrastructure to ensure 5pc GDP growth. Multilateral development banks (MDB) invest around $40 billion in developing country infrastructure and the private sector only $15bn. This is partly because of lack of adequate project preparation in developing countries.

Global infrastructure finance required for the structural transformation of the world economy is $90tr over 15 years, or $6tr annually. The financing gap is $2tr to $3tr. To bridge this gap, Governments should aim to contribute $1tr to $1.5tr, the private sector another $1 to $1.5tr, MDBs $150bn and official development assistance around $50bn annually.

The large and long-term finance required for infrastructure investment has to be actively mobilised. The following policy actions are essential for such mobilisation:

expanding the capacity and incentives of national and multilateral development banks to provide long-term infrastructure financing;

enabling, including through appropriate investment guidelines, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, private equity funds and endowments and the $30tr insurance sector to deploy a larger part of their capital on long-term infrastructure investment;

expanding national capital markets, especially in developing countries;

encouraging businesses to adopt frameworks for long-term value creation (rather than quarterly returns);

supporting regional and cross-border infrastructure initiatives, such as China's Belt and Road Initiative;

utilising advances in IT and digital applications eg Blockchain, to promote innovative financial products and inclusion eg mobile banking which has in some cases doubled revenue pools;

assisting the developing countries to prepare feasible/ bankable infrastructure projects (which can cost up to 10pc of project costs).

Finally, a sustainable infrastructure organisation (SIO) could be established to mobilise and deploy adequate long-term financing for infrastructure investment, especially in the developing countries.

The Group of 20 has approved the creation of a global infrastructure forum; but this would exclude the majority of developing countries. To be universal and credible, a SIO should be created under the umbrella of the United Nations which, apart from being universal, has the responsibility to mobilise, maximise and coordinate actions by governments, commercial and non-state entities to advance the realisation of the SDGs.

Such an SIO could be open to membership by states, international/regional organisations and public and private companies. It could associate selected non-governmental organisations with its work. Its activities could be financed by budgetary contributions from all members.

The SIO could create the following mechanisms to facilitate long-term sustainable infrastructure investment:

A compendium of pre-screened and viable infrastructure investment projects. 2. An execution directory containing data on both public and private companies with the capacity to execute projects. 3. A financial alliance, bringing together on one platform all major sources of long-term investment finance committed to sustainable infrastructure investment (major development banks, development finance institutions, pension funds, insurance companies, private equity funds, foundations etc.). 4. A 'FinTech' mechanism which can 'match' projects, execution capabilities and sources of financing. 5. An opportunity creation unit empowered to help developing countries prepare concrete and bankable investment projects including through pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, investment insurance, public-private partnerships, risk mitigation.

The costs of creating and operating such a small sustainable development organisation dedicated to promoting sustainable infrastructure investment would be modest as compared to its potential impact. This could ignite the world economy, alleviate poverty, assure progress towards the Paris climate change accords and ensure the implementation of the SDGs.


 
 

Some CPEC critics are incorrigible: Chinese diplomat

A senior Chinese diplomat here on Friday said some of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) critics were incorrigible.

Speaking at a seminar on 'Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and CPEC' at the Strategic Vision Institute (SVI), Lijian Zhao, who is deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy, said while there was a political consensus on CPEC in Pakistan, there were critics as well.

Government officials dub CPEC as a 'game changer' and describe it as a ray of hope for the country's faltering economy. However, lack of transparency about the projects and reports that Chinese firms earned massive profits on investments and repatriated them has often stirred criticism. Most of the times, the critics do not get convincing explanations.

Says there are two types of critics: people who are not well aware of developments under CPEC and those with an agenda

The diplomat said there were two types of critics: People who are 'not well aware of developments related to BRI and CPEC' and these individuals would change 'their perceptions once they get to know more about' the two initiatives. However, there are also 'those who are having an agenda and they will never accept CPEC.'

Mr Zhao said one of the biggest projects under CPEC - Sukkur-Multan M-5 Motorway - was expected to be completed by mid year. Meanwhile, Thakot-Havelian section of Karakoram Highway is likely to be completed by year end.

The 1,320 megawatt coal-fired power plant set up at Hub in Balochistan, he said, would be fully functional by the end of spring. The first 660 MW unit of the power plant has already been connected to the national grid while the second one would come online shortly. The Hub power plant is being completed at a cost of nearly $2 billion.

SVI President Dr Zafar Iqbal Cheema said criticism of BRI and CPEC was driven by geo-strategic considerations and power politics. Much of the criticism is because of the thinking that China is expanding at the expense of the US, he added.

'The ascendency of a geostrategic perspective precludes the understanding of its desired objectives and undermines an informed and balanced discussion and discourse. From an overriding security viewpoint, it's more being looked upon as a challenge rather than a cooperative enterprise,' he observed. The other perspective is that of geo-economics, according to which CPEC is promoting regional connectivity, infrastructure growth, trade and development.

Prof Dr Baogang He, Prof Shahram Akbarzadeh and Dr Zahid Shahab from Deakin University, Melbourne (Australia), made their presentations on various aspects of BRI and CPEC.

Dr Baogang said China had global ambitions and was exporting infrastructure in addition to building production networks and supply chains as it had accumulated knowledge, technology, raw material and wealth. He asked China to address issues related to labour, land acquisition and scale of investments.

Prof Akbarzadeh said Middle Eastern countries saw China as a partner because unlike Western countries it did not insist on 'political openness', maintained business like relations and boosted their leverages in negotiations with the US. Dr Shahab, while noting the creation of political consensus within Pakistan on CPEC, said it was a template on which consensus on other opportunities in nation building could be used.

Dr Vaqar Ahmed of Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) said CPEC added to business and investor community's confidence, attracted foreign investment and accelerated the economic growth allowing GDP to grow at over 5pc after a decade.

Ambassador Nicolaus Keller and his wife Ursula Keller hosted an art exhibition at the Austrian residence. The event was attended by a great number of ambassadors, UN staff, and members of the public.

In their speeches, the new Austrian ambassador, his wife and the artist, Wendy Billingslea underlined how pleased they were with the great turnout, and Mr Keller promised more exhibitions and other cultural events saying that he had recently served in the culture division in the foreign office in Austria.

'I am glad he continues the practice founded by his predecessor Ambassador Brigitta Blaha', said a Pakistani woman attending the exhibition.

Ambassador Keller said that the reason for the exhibition having been given a French title, Images teintêes d'orient, was that it was related to the upcoming week of the French language, La samaine de la francophonie. The artist herself is a French national, working out of Paris.

'The brightly coloured paintings are neither French nor Austrian, but have an international flavour to them', said a Pakistan visitor.

The artist said: 'Continually studying the history of art inspires my paintings. The more I look and learn about the treasures of the past civilizations, the more fascinated I become.'

'I feel the medium of painting is a powerful conceptual tool to communicate from the heart and the mind's eye in today's world of screens, digits and wires', Ms Billingslea said.

Chinese diplomat speaks at SVI

Chinese Deputy Ambassador Zhao Lijian speaks at the seminar at the Strategic Vision Institute (SVI) in Islamabad.

Zhao Lijian, deputy chief of mission of the Chinese Embassy, was the chief guest at a seminar at the Strategic Vision Institute (SVI) along with two Australian, one Chinese and two Pakistani speakers, chaired by Professor Zafar Iqbal Cheema. The theme of the seminar was the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and their impact on development in South West Asia. Several diplomats attended the seminar along with researchers, university teachers, private sector representatives and other guests.

Zhao Lijian is coordinator of CPEC at the Chinese Embassy.

'I was impressed by the detailed knowledge that Mr Lijian mastered about CPEC projects and activities', said a participant. 'He also spoke about projects other than those related to CPEC and said there are 22,000 Pakistani students in China'.

Dr. Vaqar Ahmed of SDPI drew attention to a number of areas where CPEC projects can be expanded.

A German-Pakistani participant drew attention to the need for CPEC projects to be spread geographically and in regards to the subject area, for example, with more activities in Gilgit-Baltistan.

This point created a lively debate, which continued during the pleasant tea session at the end of the event.

S. Lankan independence anniversary celebrated

The high commissioner and chief guest underlined in their speeches the cordial relations between the two countries, also stressing the potential for further cooperation in trade, tourism, education and other fields.

A group of dancers put on a show at the event.

'I cannot remember that we have had such a large number of dancers performing so well before', said a retired Pakistani couple.

'It looks easy and light, but it is indeed much more strenuous than it looks, both for men and the women dancers', said a European guest who had been a ballet dancer when she was young.

When the speeches and dance performances were over, a generous dinner was served. 'There were so many dishes from Sri Lanka. I could only taste some of the varieties', said a foreign diplomat. 'It reminded me of the pleasant years I had in Colombo', she said.

Pakistan-China Institute (PCI) on Thursday launched an initiative, 'Friends of Silk Road', to bring together different segments of society.

Speaking on the occasion, Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Reforms Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiyar highlighted importance of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

'CPEC is an iconic initiative, and is beyond regional divide,' he said. According to a press release, the minister said five years ago Pakistan was energy deficient but now it had energy to kick off economic growth.'

He said after the visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan to China and upon the conclusion of the 8th Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) on CPEC, it had been decided that 2019 would be the year of industrial cooperation.

'Special focus will be given to the industrial sector as well as agriculture.'

Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, Chairman of PCI, said the 'Friends of Silk Road' was a major initiative, and given Pakistan's pivotal role on CPEC as well as Pakistan's longstanding relationship with China, it was now elevated from an 'all weather friendship' to being 'iron brothers.' He said Pakistan was the first among the BRI countries to launch the forum which would include local communities, parliamentarians, press, business and opinion leaders, youth and women, professionals and civil society, students and scholars.

'The forum will provide both a better understanding and information about benefits of the fruits of progress and development offered by the numerous opportunities arising out of the BRI through CPEC.

Head of a Chinese delegation, Gao Yunlong said the two countries' all-weather friendship was based on public support and mutual trust. 'Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Xi Jinping held a meeting, after which a consensus was formed in building a closer community, which will set the course for future bilateral relations.'

He said CPEC was the flagship project of the BRI, and had yielded many positive results.

'Out of 22 cooperative projects under CPEC, nine have been completed and 13 are under construction. Pakistan has shown to be a strong supporter and active player for the projects under CPEC, and has shown a positive response.'

Leader of the House in Senate Syed Shibli Faraz said CPEC is unique when it comes to infrastructural development.

'Unfortunately, the benefits of CPEC weren't understood better before. Now that we are in government, we have come to realise that CPEC will be extremely beneficial for small industries and businesses,' he added.

Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing inaugurated an exhibition of photographs showcasing the progress of China over the last few decades at the Chinese Studies Centre at the National University of Sciences and Technology (Nust). The event marked the advent of the Chinese New Year and depicted the impact of reforms and the Chinese Open Door Policy.

Nust Rector retired Lt Gen Naweed Zaman welcomed the ambassador and spoke about the relationship between China and Pakistan and China and Nust.

He said: 'NUST has worked on plans and initiatives in collaboration with Chinese higher education institutions to harness opportunities from the One Belt, One Road initiative and CPEC. In May 2016, NUST had the privilege of holding the first Beijing Forum outside of China.'

The ambassador said Pak-China relations would continue to become stronger with each generation and the important thing was to expand and deepen people-to-people contact. To this end, he said, the number of scholarships for Pakistani students in China will be increased.

He said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a long-term project and its next phase will focus on investment, joint ventures, the establishment of special economic zones (SEZs), engagement in the power sector as well as export-oriented cooperation. Education, health, agriculture, poverty reduction and human resources were all sectors of cooperation during the next phase.

Oxbridge lecture on TAPI gas pipeline

Irshadullah Khan with Turkmen Ambassador Atadjan Movlamov and CEO and Chairman of the TAPI Pipeline Company Mohammatmyrat Amanov.

Irshadullah Khan, the secretary general of Oxbridge, the Oxford and Cambridge Society, chaired its February lecture last week. The speaker was Muhammatmyrat Amanov, CEO and chairman of the TAPI Pipeline Company, headquartered in Turkmenistan.

Mr Amanov spoke about the strategic importance of the gas pipeline, which connects Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.

Turkmen Ambassador Atadjan Movlamov presided over the lecture, which was well attended by diplomats, including Afghan Ambassador Shukrullah Atif Mashal, Indian High Commissioner Ajay Bisaria and several retired Pakistani ambassadors and civil servants.

The speaker gave an overview of the project, from its beginnings in the 1990s. In response to questions, he said security was well taken care of and he anticipated that gas prices would be lower than competing products but he could not fix a price. He said a large construction project like TAPI, which includes building an 1,814 kilometre pipeline through several countries, started in 2015 and was quite complicated. He assured that it was well underway.

'I found the lecture interesting and I am certainly quite optimistic about the potential of the project,' retired ambassador Ali Sarwar Naqvi, who currently heads the Centre for International Strategic Studies, said.

Singaporean firms evince interest in trade, investment

Many Singaporean companies are getting interested in vast trade and investment opportunities offered by a 'changing' Pakistan.

'We see some changes coming in Pakistan… and we think that we have best chance here with the present government in place to increase bilateral trade and investment relations,' Shamsher Zaman, the vice chairman of the South Asia Business Group of Singapore, told Dawn in an interview on Saturday.

Mr Zaman, who manages a large petrochemicals business that markets chemicals in 40 countries around the world and was heading a big delegation representing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as large multinational firms from Singapore, said the Singaporean companies would like to share and participate in Pakistan's economic development.

'We are here to look at opportunities for cooperation in the infrastructure, information and communication technology (ICT), healthcare and so on. We are also looking at the moment the ways to help Pakistan increase its exports and not only to Singapore. Singapore is a place where all international traders are located. If we can engage them they can buy Pakistani products for distribution all over the world,' Mr Zaman, who is heading a delegation of companies from the island city-state, emphasised.

South Asia Business Group of Singapore vice chairman Shamsher Zaman seeks opportunities for cooperation in infrastructure, info tech

He said the purpose of bringing the business delegation to Pakistan is to connect the business community in Singapore and Pakistan. 'Having assisted Singapore Business Federation (SBF), the apex business body in the city-state, I have realised that there is no engagement with Pakistan. With this in mind I am trying to facilitate Singapore companies to come to Pakistan and engage with its business community.'

Currently, the trade between the two countries stands at $1.2 billion with Pakistan importing goods worth $1.1bn from Singapore and exporting products worth only $89 million in the financial year 2018, says Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS). Singapore invested $33.6m, including portfolio investment of $10m, in Pakistan last fiscal, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

'The current bilateral engagement on the business level is very low… the total trade between the two countries is very small compared with Singapore's total trade of $800bn. From investment point of view, Singaporean companies have invested more than $850bn around the world. I am trying to see if we can help bring some portion of those investments to Pakistan? If we can increase bilateral trade into a few billion dollars and then gradually increase it? So we are here to identify areas where we can grow together,' he said.

Asked about his views on business climate in Pakistan, he said finance minister Asad Umer had told in his meeting with the delegation that Pakistan was nowhere close on ease of doing business with Singapore but it is improving. 'I also think if there is some will to do… and some improvement comes in, it has to be gradual. Change doesn't come overnight. I feel that the time is right we came in here and see the change happening and business environment improving here. So this is something very positive.'

He went on: 'Business climate here is not ideal but our companies have gone to more difficult countries and have been very successful. In the Middle East, for example, it was not what you see today... the UAE is still ok but in other (ME) countries procedures are still improving over a period of time. We understand the intention of the (Pakistan) government, the will of the government and opportunities available here and can jointly work for economic development of Pakistan.

Mr Zaman said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was a great example where companies of the two countries could work together as the Singapore government is also very interested in participating in the Belt and Road Initiative of China. 'But the business communities should engage each other. Engagement is the key here. I haven't seen any delegation coming from Singapore to Pakistan before or a Pakistani engaging our businessmen. So this delegation is the step in this direction. We have requested FPCCI to send a delegation. We also have asked individual businessmen to please come to Singapore. We will connect them with the right people even if Pakistani businessmen don't want to come as part of a delegation. There are a lot of opportunities in Pakistan but people (in Singapore) don't know about them. Engagement has to be an ongoing process. This visit is a good beginning for future engagement between the business communities of the two countries.'


 
 

Shaping Pakistan's future

'NATIONS fail economically because of extractive institutions. These institutions keep poor countries poor and prevent them from embarking on the path of economic growth.'

This excerpt from the book Why Nations Fail, a seminal work on the subject by two of the world's foremost economists, could relate to the Pakistan of today. More than seven decades after its formation, Pakistan remains one of the poorest nations, sliding behind regional countries on almost all social and economic indicators.

Although we pride ourselves as being a nuclear-armed state, the security of the country is threatened by a failing economy, population explosion, poverty and environmental degradation. A massive youth bulge and a rising uneducated and unskilled population with few prospects of finding productive employment present a terrifying scenario. But can this situation be turned around? Where will Pakistan be three decades from now when it crosses the 100-year mark?

In its landmark report, Pakistan@100: Shaping the Future, the World Bank projects two scenarios. One would take Pakistan to a $2 trillion economy by the year 2047, placing the country in the middle-income Second World group. This is a highly optimistic scenario that requires the country to achieve sustainably high economic growth rates for approximately the next three decades.

Pakistan's situation today suggests that it will not be able to generate a demographic dividend.

The second scenario is extremely depressing. Failing to change the country will cause it to slide further into the abyss of poverty. Pakistan today is standing at a crossroads and, as the report warns, decisions over the next decade will decide Pakistan's future. It all depends on whether we are willing to change the extractive nature of the state institutions that mainly serve the interests of a small ruling elite, and so remove the fetters that prevent the country from embarking on the path of economic growth and social progress.

A major challenge is how to transform a crumbling institutional structure and address the key constraints to economic growth. Pakistan will have to overcome the barriers to structural transformation that have been stifling its development in previous decades. Partial and half-hearted reforms cannot take Pakistan out of the current morass. It is not just about economic growth but also the welfare of the people that matters.

One of the major reasons for our backwardness, as pointed out by the report, has been low investment in developing human capital. Investments in family planning, maternal health and early childhood development are the foundation of human capital accumulation. The empowerment of women is a key component of efforts to increase human capital in Pakistan. 'A first priority for Pakistan is to make the best use of its greatest asset, its people,' the report said.

Pakistan has one of the highest population growth rates in the world, offsetting efforts to improve social indicators. With a 2.4 per cent growth rate, Pakistan's population has crossed the 208 million mark, making it the fifth largest populated country. It is sitting on a potential demographic disaster with more than 60pc of its population under 25 years of age. The number of individuals ready for the labour market is expanding faster than the total population.

According to the report, Pakistan's situation today suggests that it will not be able to generate a demographic dividend. The inability of the state to productively utilise a large young generation has already turned the country into a breeding ground for violent extremism, and could cause further social dislocation and conflict.

The Pakistani you bulge: a ticking time bomb

The fertility rate in Pakistan is far higher than that in other regional countries. The population growth rate must be brought down to 1.4pc to achieve the goal of entering the middle-income group. But there seems no urgency to contain the population explosion.

Regional conflicts have also been a strong factor in exacerbating Pakistan's economic woes. Strained relations with neighbours have closed opportunities for economic cooperation and the expansion of trade. Hostile borders and the country's being a front-line state in the Afghan wars over the last four decades has had huge costs in both economic and social terms.

The blowback of the conflict in the region has turned Pakistan itself into a battlefield. The internal security problems have also affected foreign and domestic investments, retarding our economic growth. High expenditure on defence leaves few resources for economic and human infrastructure development. Peace could open up massive opportunities for expansion of trade and economic cooperation. A transition from a national security state to a social welfare state is critical to shaping Pakistan's future.

Increased regional cooperation and connectivity must be a top priority in order to achieve structural transformation and a stronger economy. Higher investment in economic and human development will also ensure our national security. The traditional approach of security is becoming increasing unsustainable.

Pakistan occupies a pivotal position in what is described by Peter Frankopan, an Oxford professor, as a 'silk road'. According to the author of The New Silk Roads, 'We are living in the Asian century already, a time when the movement of global GDP from developed economies of the West to those of the East is taking place at an astonishing scale and at an astonishing speed'. Its geographical position provides Pakistan a massive opportunity to transform the country into a trade and transit hub.

Surely CPEC, which is the flagship project of China's ambitious One Belt One Road scheme, can open up vast economic and connectivity opportunities for Pakistan. Given its geostrategic position, Pakistan has the potential to serve as a nexus for the two routes envisaged under OBOR the continental Eurasian 'silk road economic belt' and the Southeast Asian 'maritime silk road'.

According to the report, increasing regional integration within South Asia could cause Pakistan's economy to expand by 30pc by 2047. Stronger regional relations can support Pakistan's economic transformation and security objectives, increasing its leverage to resolve disputes with its neighbours and freeing up resources for public investment in economic and human development.

But that requires a clear strategy for greater integration with other countries in the region. With clear policy direction and political will, Pakistan could join the other countries as a formidable economic power at the age of 100.


 
 

CPEC: When the alarm goes off

There is no doubt that successful completion of CPEC will revolutionize the power sector making it highly efficient. There are added benefits in the growth of GDP, export and balance of payments. However, its successful completion requires substantial policy making and enormous planning.

Publicly available policy related documents include CPEC Long Term Plan (LTP) and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). CPEC consists of numerous agreements, however these agreements are not available to conduct a cost and benefit analysis of CPEC.

All publicly available documents discuss the benefits CPEC will generate and policy measures Government of Pakistan should take to ensure these benefits materialise. However, the benefits discussed are quite generic.

The veil of secrecy raises serious concerns when state institutions like SBP disclose lack of access to CPEC related agreements.

Extensive research shone light on the absence of any documents which specifically identified benefits with reference to original agreements. This veil of secrecy over CPEC raises serious concerns when state institutions like the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) disclose lack of access to CPEC related agreements. A research on the financial and legal aspects of CPEC turns on alarm bells for the following matters

First, Pakistan's attempt to make Saudi Arabia one of the strategic partners for CPEC has failed on account of presumably China's reluctance to accept Saudi Arabia as a partner. There is no transparency to justify China reasons for doing this.

Second, IMF raised concerns over whether potential funding would be used to repay CPEC related debt to China. IMF requiring assurance from the government over the use of its funds also brings to question the financial structures applicable to CPEC.

Third, numbers available on the Board of Investment website indicate CPEC's worth to be around $45 billion in investment that serves two sectors energy and infrastructure. Energy sector consumes around $34bn of the investment whereas the infrastructure sector accounts for approximately $10bn.

However, the capital structures of CPEC related agreements are not available publicly. It is not possible to identify the exact amount of borrowing, and the cost of borrowing, the government has accepted from China. Therefore, CPEC related Chinese debt cannot be compared to debt available in international money markets to gauge whether it is cheaper or more expensive.

Fourth, SBP is unable to identify the source of finance for the import of machinery from China for CPEC related projects. Dr Ishrat Hussain, former governor SBP, explained that the only reason SBP has been unable to trace the source of funds is that the Chinese machinery is being financed by Chinese banks. In other words, Pakistan banking industry does not benefit through CPEC. Instead Pakistan's import bill is increasing along with borrowings from Chinese banks. It is rather like Pakistan is borrowing from China to invest into Chinese machinery to carry out CPEC related projects.

Fifth, the capital requirement for foreign banks to open a bank head office in Pakistan is Rs3bn. However, there is a question of parity between capital requirements to open a bank in China versus opening a bank in Pakistan. Moreover, Habib Bank Limited has opened a bank branch in China two years back but the details of the operations of the branch are not available publicly (just like its branch operations in the UK, US and other parts of the world are available on the main website). Therefore, it is not possible to examine the benefits the bank is deriving through its China branch, particularly in the context of CPEC.

Finally, non-availability of actual agreements signed under CPEC is the reason there is no clarity regarding dispute resolution mechanism. It is not known what choice of law and jurisdiction are applicable to CPEC, nor is it possible to figure out potential venue for resolution of dispute. This is a serious issue since SBP has warned that in the past, trade agreements between Pakistan and China have always been more beneficial for the latter than the former.

It is high time for the government to engage the Finance Ministry and SBP to conduct a cost benefit analysis of CPEC agreements in terms of finance and law. This analysis has to be made public to ensure transparency as well as credibility of CPEC.

Chinese cities Urumqi, Puyang and Xi'an were declared as sister cities to Karachi, Gwadar, and Multan, respectively, at a forum held in Beijing on Thur­sday to strengthen the bond of friendship between the two countries.

According to a press release issued here, federal Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination Dr Fehmida Mirza headed a Pakistani delegation at the event during which Pakistani and Chinese officials signed separate agreements in this regard.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Mirza said Pakistan highly valued its relationship and mutual cooperation with China.

She expressed the hope that people-to-people contact and diplomatic visits between the two countries would further deepen bilateral relations at political, social, cultural and economical levels. She underscored the importance of the One Belt One Road project and termed it a milestone initiative for regional connectivity. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project was a basic pillar of Belt and Road Initiative under which most of the early harvest projects had been completed, especially in the fields of infrastructure and energy, she added.

The minister, on behalf of the people of Pakistan, acknowledged and appreciated China's support for Pakistan in the recent situation and playing a role in de-escalating tension in South Asia.

She observed that the visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan to China had given a new impetus to Pakistan-China friendship and opened up several new avenues of cooperation.

It was informed at the event that the forum would facilitate cooperation in province-city management, public health, environmental protection, poverty alleviation, trade and investment, tourism cooperation, urbanisation and vocational/professional education. It will enhance mutual understanding between enterprises of the two countries and boost economic and trade ties.

Pakistan's Ambassador to China Masood Khalid and the Executive Vice Governor of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Zhang Chunlin, also addressed the forum.


 
 

Panelists call for ending role of corporate sector in agriculture

Speakers at a seminar on Friday demanded an end to the role of international corporate sector in agriculture, opposed the ever-increasing allotment of land to the corporate sector and called for just and equitable distribution of land among small and landless farmers in order to turn Pakistan into a real agricultural country.

The event organised at the Peshawar Press Club to commemorate the International Day of the Landless Farmers was arranged by Pakistan Kissan Mazdoor Tehreek (PKMT), and Roots for Equity in collaboration with Asian Peasant Coalition, Pesticide Action Network, Asia Pacific and International Women's Alliance.

PKMT national coordinator Altaf Hussain, Asian Peasant Coalition's general secretary Raja Mueeb, PKMT's coordinator Peshawar Shehzad Baig and KP coordinator Fayyaz Ahmed were the main speakers.

They said the day highlighted the struggle of the landless farmers for genuine land reforms and food sovereignty.

They said farmers were being evicted from lands that had been tilled for generations by their ancestors. They demanded that development projects across the country, including those for special economic zones as well as land lease to investors, should be scrapped.

On the occasion, Altaf Hussain said from 2000 onwards, transnational corporations worldwide had grabbed more than 50 million hectares of land through over 1,500 agreements.

Similarly, Raja Mueeb said more than 200 deals spanning almost 20 million hectares of land were further being negotiated. Most of the land deals were being carried out in countries like Pakistan that are rich in natural resources, he pointed out.

It was pathetic that only eight per cent of these land deals were exclusively for food production, and 60 percent of these, were for export purposes, he said, adding around 70 per cent of these deals were reserved for agro-fuel production, which was only fulfilling the needs of the rich capitalist countries.

Mr Mueeb said in the past few years, China's One Belt One Road initiative had further accelerated land grab.

Fayyaz Ahmed pointed out that various development projects for energy and infrastructure under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project had resulted in land grab across the country.

He pointed out that 1,000 acres of land had been leased in Haripur for a special economic zone, the Northern Bypass Peshawar; 6,500 acres of land was leased for growing high yield seeds to a foreign corporation in Punjab; and 140 acres of land were leased in Khairpur, Sindh for a special economic zone.

He said farmers and fishermen were losing their livelihoods due to these measures.

Shehzad Baig said small and landless farmers were facing exploitation because of unjust distribution of land, corporate agriculture. He said the government was also planning to build a cement factory in Palai area of Malakand, a greenbelt famous for its farmlands and orange orchards.


 
 

' China  sees CPEC as a way of creating free market'

'Eight years ago when I had entered the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies at the University of Oxford, the focus there was on India but today our focus is truly on South Asia where the study on India is not possible without knowing about Pakistan,' said Prof Dr Mathew McCartney at the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs on Saturday.

Dr McCartney, who teaches political economy and human development of South Asia at Oxford University, was speaking on the subject of 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: Sustainable Economic Growth and Industrial Policy in Contemporary Pakistan' here.

The research scholar said that it was also why he decided to come to Pakistan to research CPEC while on a sabbatical.

Pakistan's economic focus has moved from IMF to China, says Oxford professor

'When I look back some 15 years, I have observed that the International Monetary Fund [IMF] was discussed more here in Pakistan when you talked about economic growth but now that focus too has moved to China,' he said.

'A resilient economy'

'If you look at the economic story of Pakistan from the time of independence, you can see that Pakistan is not a miracle economy but it has moderate economic success, first through agriculture exports and then, after the 1980s, through the export of manufactured goods. This country has not had an economic recession since 1960. It is more of a resilient economy with a size of over $300 billion,' he said.

He added that Pakistan was one of the first countries to recognise China in 1950 and later during the 1960s China helped Pakistan in the construction of the Karakoram Highway.

'CPEC really does seem like the culmination of a much longer economic cooperation with China for Pakistan. So here is a long-term committed China-Pakistan relationship unlike what the USA is criticised of,' he said. 'Still, there may be a lot more going on other than China's 'One Belt, One Road' initiative outside Pakistan that is happening inside it, which is crucial to know for a big project of $60bn, that is CPEC.'

He added that despite a lot of concerns over CPEC's motivation and liability, and Pakistan not known to complete most of its donor-funded agreements, the last four administrations in Pakistan have remained committed to it.

Still, he reminded that CPEC was only agreed in 2015 so we are still in its early stages and it is quite difficult to evaluate the success of big projects when different groups within it are after different things.

'The big infrastructure projects such as the energy projects, highways and railways are still in their development stages,' he said. 'Big infrastructure projects can help economic growth with predictable as well as unpredictable outcomes.'

Then he questioned whether the economies of western China and Pakistan were complementing each other or competing with each other? 'The more complementary they are the more potential there is for economic gains,' he said. 'But if they are competitive ... they don't seem to promise economic gains,' he said.

'CPEC would make transport lines more effective, naturally with shorter routes also being created for greater efficiency so exporters in China will find it easier to send out their goods while using Pakistan as a transport link. China sees CPEC not really as a commitment to industry but a way of creating a free market where exports from China will see a surge while exports from Pakistan will be stagnated,' suggested Dr McCartney.

Still, he said, though he was pessimistic about CPEC, he felt optimistic about Pakistan.

'Because CPEC will have a positive effect on Pakistan, better than the IMF programmes could do. And although the financial impacts of CPEC are still not very clear, China's commitment to creating trade routes is, which may also help Pakistan in the long term,' he concluded.


 
 

Peace is difficult

THE recent military crisis with India was a baptism of fire for Prime Minister Imran Khan and the PTI government. In the event, the Pakistani leader emerged as a responsible statesman while Modi exposed himself as a rash warmonger.

The Pakistani prime minister has expressed the hope that after his anticipated re-election, Prime Minister Modi will be strong enough to politically to engage in a dialogue for peace with Pakistan. He has similarly expressed hope for peace in Afghanistan through the US-Afghan Taliban talks which Pakistan has facilitated.

Unfortunately, peace is difficult to achieve in the present global environment. A new Cold War is under way between the US and China. The Washington 'establishment' views India as an essential ally in its global competition with China. After the Pulwama suicide attack, US National Security Adviser John Bolton immediately proclaimed India's 'right to self-defence', providing New Delhi a virtual 'carte blanche' to proceed with its threatened military action, irrespective of the inherent risk of a wider Pakistan-India war. Responsibility to avoid a conflict by acting against Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) was placed on Pakistan.

US mediation to prevent a wider war was activated only after Pakistan retaliated against India's incursion, downed two Indian aircraft, captured an Indian pilot and, reportedly, 'locked' its missiles on to several Indian targets in response to similar Indian action. Pakistan's foreign minister was gracious in acknowledging US mediation. Yet, the lesson from the episode is clear: strength is the only sure way to deter an aggressive adversary and secure even-handed outcomes.

India is unlikely to offer any meaningful compromises to resolve the Kashmir dispute.

It remains to be seen if after their anticipated re-election, Modi and the BJP agree to resume a dialogue with Pakistan. But, even if talks resume, India is unlikely to offer any meaningful compromises to resolve the Kashmir dispute or move away from the aim of imposing an India-dominated 'order' in South Asia and beyond.

This presumption is reinforced by the BJP's electoral manifesto, which promises to transform India into a 'Hindu rashtra' (state), build a Hindu temple on the site of the destroyed Babri Masjid and strip Kashmir's special and autonomous status under the Indian constitution.

What India desires is that Pakistan accept India's rule in India-occupied Kashmir, much as Israel's Arab neighbours are being asked to accept the 'reality' of Israel's occupation of Jerusalem, the Golan and most of the West Bank. But, unlike Israel's neighbours, Pakistan has not been militarily defeated by India. Even if Pakistan were to set aside its strategic stakes in Kashmir (territory, affiliated people, water, China access), it will continue to be drawn into supporting the resilient 70-year struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination and freedom (azadi) from India.

Peace with India will have to be promoted the hard way, through possession of the capability to deter and defeat Indian aggression or 'diktat' and insistence on equitable negotiated solutions to outstanding disputes.

Likewise, building peace in Afghanistan remains an imposing challenge.

Pakistan's facilitation of the US-Taliban talks appears to have been quietly 'pocketed' by Washington without offering anything tangible in return. The IMF has insisted on onerous conditions for financial support. The threat of the FATF 'black list' has not been lifted. Pakistan's blocked CSF funds have not been released. No concern has been voiced by the US regarding India's UN-documented human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. Far from censuring India's military aggression of Feb 26, the US, together with the UK and France, has moved a resolution in the Security Council to place JeM's Maulana Azhar on the terrorism 'list'.

The unfortunate reality is that Pakistan has been categorised as an adversary by the US 'establishment', due to: America's 'strategic partnership' with India against China and 'radical Islamic terrorism'; the blame assigned to Pakistan for the US military failure in Afghanistan; Pakistan's nuclear weapons capability, and the considerable influence in Washington of the Indian-American expatriate community, the Israeli lobby and Christian 'fundamentalists'.

At present, this hostility towards Pakistan is tempered by Washington's need for Pakistan's support to US-Taliban dialogue. Yet, here too, Islamabad's help is perhaps being taken for granted. Not only have no concessions been extended to Pakistan, but US special representative Zalmay Khalilzad and the US ambassador in Kabul have felt free to publicly criticise the Pakistani prime minister's reference to the anticipated future interim government in Afghanistan. Pakistan needs to retain continuing leverage in the Afghan peace process and secure concrete US concessions to reciprocate its help in this process.

Khalilzad has played his cards well so far, outlining the US withdrawal structure and the Taliban's anti-terrorism commitments before turning to an intra-Afghan dialogue in which representatives of the Ashraf Ghani government can be incorporated.

Yet, despite his diplomatic skills, there is no assurance that Khalilzad's process will yield peace in Afghanistan. Afghan warlords, such as Dostum, are unlikely to reconcile with the Taliban. Sooner or later, Iran is likely to retaliate in Afghanistan and elsewhere against US sanctions, especially after the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards as a 'terrorist' organisation. This could disrupt the Afghan peace process. Moreover, time may run out on Khalilzad. The Taliban's gains in the coming 'fighting season' may settle Afghanistan's future on the battlefield.

Khalilzad recently briefed the envoys of China, Russia and the EU to build wider support for his process. China can help by investing generously in Afghanistan and building its regional connectivity. Russia's role may be critical in defeating the Islamic State-Khorasan. Both powers can help to build a consensus for peace within Afghanistan and among its neighbours.

China and Russia may also hold the key to peace in South Asia. Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping have sought to halt India's rush into America's strategic embrace, emphasising the enormous benefits of trans-Asian cooperation and the high costs of confrontation.

Peace could come to the entire region if India decides to become a part of the Asian 'order' being created under the Belt and Road Initiative and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Unfortu­nately, Modi and the BJP's obsessive ambition to emerge as China's 'equal' has propelled them towards an alliance with America and may consign South Asia to remain a 'zone of crisis' in the New Cold War.

Prime Minister Imran Khan will pay a four-day visit to China to attend the Belt and Road Forum and hold bilateral talks with the Chinese leadership on the new phase of the China-Pakistan Econo­mic Corridor (CPEC) and other issues of mutual interest.

The Foreign Office, while announcing the prime minister's visit, said Mr Khan would be 'visiting China from April 25 to 28 to attend the 2nd Belt and Road Forum in Beijing'. He would also hold bilateral meetings with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang and the two countries would sign several MoUs and agreements to enhance bilateral cooperation, it added.

Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing, speaking at the launching ceremony of a book titled, 'CPEC A Precursor to Regional Economic Growth and Stability', published by the Strategic Vision Institute (SVI), said: 'Prime Minister (Imran Khan) is going to China next week and on that occasion, our leaders jointly working with him will elaborate the next stage of CPEC.' He said that the new stage of the CPEC was about broadening the area of cooperation under CPEC and it would have three pillars the greater involvement of private sector; social sector cooperation; and the involvement of third party partners in CPEC projects.

Giving an overview of the progress on the setting up of special economic zones, the envoy said the zone in Rashakai (KP) had been finalised, documentation had been completed and groundwork had started. The two sides, he said, were working on other SEZs including one high-tech SEZ in Islamabad, involving some of the top Chinese tech companies, and one in Dhabeji (Sindh), which will have heavy industries. Chinese investors, he said, were signing up joint ventures with Pakistani firms in a local industrial zone in Faisalabad as well.

'All joint ventures and investments should be treated as CPEC priorities,' he said.

He said that an agreement on social sector cooperation in the fields of education, health, agriculture, irrigation, poverty alleviation, and human resource development would be signed during Mr Khan's visit to China. A total of 27 social sector projects benefiting the common people, he said, were being started with the Chinese grant of $1 billion. The Chinese government, he said, would also give 20,000 scholarships to Pakistanis over the next couple of years.

Moreover, Ambassador Jing said that the two sides had agreed on involving the third party partners in CPEC projects.

'All countries are welcome to participate in Pakistan's economic development,' he said, adding that CPEC projects 'are inclusive, open, and all embracing'.

The envoy said that the Chinese government had full confidence in Pakistan's future and its interest was China's interest.

Speaking on the occasion, the chairman of Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, said that CPEC was a strategic national project, which was above party affiliations and provincial considerations. He said that the corridor was contributing to the strengthening of the federation by developing infrastructure and bringing progress and prosperity to the country.

He said 'the best of CPEC' was yet to come, although the project had already made significant contributions in terms of addressing energy crisis, operationalising of the Gwadar port and activation of Thar Coal project.

Senator Mushahid said that Pakistan would become the hub of emerging 'greater South Asia', which he believed would not just include Saarc countries, but also China, Iran, and the Gulf region. He rejected threats of containing China saying it was an outdated cold war mindset, which was irrelevant to the 21st century Asia.

SVI President Dr Zafar Iqbal Cheema said that CPEC not only merits a more informed narrative, but based on the current government's re-prioritisation of the goals of the project, there was a need for re-setting of the discourse on CPEC.

Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing on Thursday urged the business community to expand cooperation and connectivity with Chinese traders as Pakistan and China were entering the new leg of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

'The Chinese companies and factories are ready to transfer technical expertise and relocate their businesses in Pakistan,' he said while speaking at a business-to-business (B2B) conference.

The conference was a part of International Rawal Exhibition 2019 being organised by Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) at a local hotel.

The Chinese envoy said the government of Pakistan had taken key steps towards a visa regime and ease of doing business and he was hopeful that this would further enhance bilateral cooperation and trade linkages.

'The Chinese government is looking forward to the upcoming visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan to China during the last week of April during which he is scheduled to attend the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Forum,' he said.

The discussions on the next phase of CPEC, the ambassador said, related to a stronger involvement of the private sector, including the activation of special economic zones, social sector cooperation and the involvement of third-country partners.

He lauded RCCI's efforts for organising the exhibition. The Rawal Expo now has become a brand of RCCI and a regular annual feature, he added.

'We (Chinese) now feel associated with Rawal Expo as this year again more than 40 companies related to foods, electronics, textile and services sectors have set up stalls in it,' he said.

Earlier, RCCI President Malik Shahid Saleem said the expo provided a platform to local manufacturers to showcase their products and have close interaction with Chinese counterparts.

He expressed the hope that such exhibitions would boost SMEs in the country. The joint ventures between Chinese and Pakistani companies will increase the ownership of key stakeholders, he added.

He said the more we have local ownership in the projects the more it will be successful.

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Chinese and Pakistani companies was also signed.

Meanwhile, Punjab Board of Investment and Trade (PBIT) Chairman Sardar Tanveer Ilyas Khan said the government wanted the domestic industry to grow further and increase their exports through joint ventures and expansion. The PBIT will provide all possible support to them in this regard.

He said Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar was very keen in further investments in Punjab, and wanted the local industry to grow further and play a pivotal role in increasing the foreign direct investment in Punjab.

He said as per vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan things were moving at a rapid pace and improving day by day in Punjab.

'People will see Punjab emerging as investment friendly province where PBIT staff is working day and night to provide all possible support to their business community,' he said.


 
 

Managing security and economy

MANY interpret the government's recent reshuffle of the federal cabinet as a way of venting its frustration over a seemingly intractable economic challenge. The reshuffle came days before Prime Minister Imran Khan's scheduled visits to Iran and China, where economic and security cooperation will be among the major points of discussion. In particular, Pakistan anticipates more relief from Beijing, mainly in terms of an early launch of the Special Economic Zones under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

China is considerate of Pakistan's economic woes. However, Chinese investors demand the award of projects on softer terms and on a fast track. They also consider investment in the country risky. Their main concern is the prevailing insecurity in Balochistan where a multitude of separatist and religiously inspired militant groups are creating an environment detrimental to the implementation of CPEC projects and the functioning of the Gwadar port.

The recent attack on security officials travelling on the Makran coastal highway, which is considered a safe highway in the province, will certainly add to Chinese concerns. The Baloch insurgents have perpetrated some high-impact attacks in recent times, including a few suicide blasts, which have started to defy the oft-told tale that the Baloch insurgency is a low-scale conflict. Secondly, Baloch separatist groups have started to launch joint attacks; the latest one, hitting security personnel on the coastal highway, was also claimed by an alliance of three separatist groups.

The timing of the attack will not help Prime Minister Khan convince the Chinese and Iranian leaders of an improving security situation in Balochistan. His visit to Tehran was long due and overshadowed by the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's visit to Pakistan. Border security will be the high point of the Iranian diplomatic call during the prime minister's visit to Tehran. China, too, is concerned about insecurity at the Pakistani-Iranian border, which has become a hub of separatist and religiously motivated as well as criminal groups. This is not only causing geostrategic complications, it is also impeding progress on CPEC-related projects in coastal areas of the province.

Chinese investors demand the award of projects on softer terms and on a fast track.

Iran alleges that a Saudi-backed separatist group, Jaishul Adl, is operating from Pakistan and attacking Iranian security forces. The group launched an attack in February, killing 27 members of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and provoked tensions between the two countries. Iran's intelligence minister, Mahmoud Alavi, spoke of taking revenge on those responsible for the crime. This country sent a high-level delegation to Tehran to give assurances of a thorough investigation and cooperation in finding the culprits. As with Afghanistan, the Pakistan government has decided to fence its border with Iran too, but that is a comparatively more complex task.

Pakistan also has concerns about recurrent border violations by Iranian border security forces. In 2018, Iranian border security forces carried out six cross-border attacks in Balochistan's Chagai, Gwadar and Panjgur districts, compared to 12 such attacks in 2017. Shelling by the Iranian security guards causes much physical damage, affecting residents living along the border; sometimes it leads to the complete suspension of daily activities.

Local residents suspect that Iran has gone soft on anti-Pakistan separatist groups, especially the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), whose militants are evidently sheltering on Iranian soil. This is conceived as a counter-move by Iran though the BLF and the BLA are left-leaning secular separatist groups that also advocate the liberation of Sistan-Baluchestan in Iran.

In December 2018, an attack was claimed by the BLA that killed six Pakistani soldiers in Kech near the Pakistan-Iran border, implying BLA militants' cross-border movement for shelter. The attack occurred a day after the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding for 'improving border security and stopping the smuggling of petroleum products, drugs and arms, and human trafficking'.

Despite complicated border security issues, both sides can still develop an effective bilateral mechanism to check cross-border incursions by all shades of separatist and Islamist militants. The agendas and objectives of different brands of militants operating along the Pakistan-Iran border are known to both countries, which they can counter by working jointly. In retrospect, Iran and Pakistan have done that in past, during the regimes of Raza Shah and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in the mid-1970s, by launching an extensive security operation against the militants.

However, one cannot ignore the Saudi factor. Though Pakistan is in dire need of economic assistance, it should not close its eyes to militant proxies that can complicate Pakistan's core economic interest linked with CPEC, and a conducive security environment in Pakistan, particularly in Balochistan.

Prime Minister Khan can get a positive response on security cooperation from Tehran before his visit to Beijing where such a commitment will have a positive impact on bilateral deliberations. The removal of federal finance minister Asad Umar will also be read positively by Beijing; not only did he fail to run the economy of the country but was also responsible for the slowing down of the execution of CPEC projects.

Pakistan needs CPEC to sustain its economy; unfortunately, the vague and sluggish policy responses of the current government, as well as its overconfidence in attracting foreign investment by mobilising the Pakistani diaspora, has damaged not only CPEC but also the overall economy of the country. The worsening economic condition is forcing the country to put the economic focus back on CPEC. However, the direction will become clearer only after the new adviser on finance and his team lay out the government's revised economic roadmap - if there is any.

China wants to make the Belt and Road Initiative a success story, and CPEC is an integral part of that. China realises that Pakistan has the potential to put CPEC back on the fast track. It will boost the confidence of the BRI's potential stakeholders who are reluctant at the moment to become partners in the initiative.

Still, security will remain at the heart of any potential outcome of renewed economic cooperation between Pakistan and China.

Prime Minister Imran Khan in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the second Belt and Road Forum in Beijing on Friday called for greater attention towards tackling climate change and poverty as Pakistan and China enter the next phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

The prime minister appreciated the significance of the China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as it "marks a new and distinct phase in the onward march of nations in the world along the path of globalisation".

"The presence of so many world leaders today is proof that we choose hope over despair and cooperation over confrontation. 122 states and 49 international organisations have signed onto the BRI's vision and this is a historic and monumental development," he pointed out.

"The BRI offers a model of partnership, collaboration, connectivity and shared prosperity," the prime minister told the audience. "Pakistan is proud to have partnered with China in this transformative endeavour. We have been among BRI's earliest and most enthusiastic proponents," he said.

"The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, one of the BRI's major components - and one of its earliest manifestations - has made substantial progress. Pakistan's energy supplies have increased massively, critical infrastructure gaps are being plugged, Gwadar - once a small fishing village - is transforming rapidly into a commercial hub. The Gwadar airport will be the largest in our country," he told his audience.

He informed the audience that special economic zones being set up along the CPEC offer investment opportunities for Pakistani, Chinese and foreign entrepreneurs and invited them to "avail Pakistan's liberal foreign investment regime and participate in our economy, in particular infrastructure, railways, dams, IT and manufacturing."

"Together Pakistan and China are entering the next phase of CPEC, with greater emphasis on socioeconomic uplift," he said, adding that the next phase would be "supplemented" by the signing of an expanded Pakistan-China Free Trade Agreement.

He added that Pakistan wants to promote cooperation with China in agriculture, health and education sectors.

"We are changing Pakistan's economic landscape and Insha Allah, the destiny of our people. I want to thank China and its leadership for their unwavering support for Pakistan," he said.

Prime Minister Imran suggested that, as the BRI takes on a more concrete shape, world leaders direct their efforts and focus onto the people of their countries by addressing impediments in the path towards sustainable growth.

He suggested collaboration on five points: mitigating the adverse effects of climate change by launching an ambitious tree-planting project; establishing a BRI tourism corridor; establishing an office for anti-corruption cooperation; creating a poverty alleviation fund; further trade liberalisation and encouraging private sector investment.

Xi's address

Chinese President Xi Jinping in his keynote address at the three-day forum said that the joint construction of the Belt and Road has opened up new space for the world's economic growth, Radio Pakistan reported.

He said that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) had also created a new platform to boost international trade and investment, expand new practices to optimise global economic governance, and make new contributions to improving the wellbeing of people of all countries.

The Chinese president said that Beijing would negotiate and sign high-standard Free Trade Agreements with more countries, and that it would allow foreign investors to operate businesses in more sectors with a controlling or full stake.

He said that China would work with other parties to promote a coalition of sustainable cities and an international coalition for green development under BRI.

PM's agenda in China

The prime minister arrived in China yesterday on a four-day official visit. According to the Foreign Office, he will attend a world leaders' meeting representing around 38 countries. He will also speak in the first session of the leaders' meeting, and hold meetings with several heads of states/governments and corporate and business leaders on the sidelines of the BRF.

In addition to participating in the Belt and Road Forum, the premier will hold bilateral meetings with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang. Pakistan and China will also sign several memoranda of understanding and agreements to enhance bilateral cooperation in diverse areas.

After the forum, the prime minister will address a Pakistan business and investment forum on April 28. Prominent Pakistani and Chinese businessmen will attend the event.

The prime minister will also participate in the Beijing International Horticul­tural Exhibition along with President Xi and other world leaders.

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday proposed a five-point action plan for improving the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) outcomes as he called for removing barriers to sustainable growth and making development people-oriented.

In his speech at the inaugural session of the second Belt and Road Forum (BRF) in Beijing, Mr Khan said: 'As the Belt and Road Initiative takes a further concrete shape, I suggest we direct our efforts and focus on the peoples of our countries, and towards addressing impediments on their way to sustainable growth'.

PM Khan is among the 37 heads of state and government participating in the second edition of the Belt and Road Forum, which is a platform for BRI partners to come together for reviewing their cooperation under the programme and charting the roadmap for future. As many as 122 states and 49 international organisations are part of Chinese BRI.

The PTI government is still reeling from a controversy erupted over a recent statement of Mr Khan in which he erroneously mentioned Japan and Germany as neighbours. But, a PTI minister had explained to the National Assembly that Mr Khan's statement was a 'slip of the tongue' and he had intended to mean France and Germany.

PM meets heads of IMF and World Bank on sidelines of Belt and Road Forum; claims five billion trees planted in KP

Apparently the PM made another slip of the tongue during his speech in the Chinese capital on Friday when he said Pakistan had planted 'five billion trees' in one of its provinces alone.

'In our country in last five years we successfully planted five billion trees in one of our provinces called KP,' he said, adding: 'Now we have launched a nationwide project to plant 10 billion trees in next five years.'

The prime minister had often taken credit that his party's government in KP had planted one billion trees during its five-year rule in the province. But, the latest claim regarding five billion trees is very hard to believe.

Mr Khan's five-point action plan includes joint efforts for mitigating climate change, establishing a BRI tourism corridor for promoting people-to-people contacts and inter-cultural understanding, setting up an office of anti-corruption cooperation, creating a poverty alleviation fund, and further liberalising trade and investment flows by encouraging private sector and businesses to collaborate in projects.

The prime minister's proposals reflect Pakistan government's priorities and he recalled his administration's massive tree plantation drive and efforts for alleviating poverty, including the launch of Ehsas programme. Some of the proposals also reflected Chinese priorities as Beijing seeks to enhance the 'quality of cooperation' under the BRI.

The prime minister recalled that Pakistan was one of the BRI's 'earliest and most enthusiastic' supporters. 'Pakistan is proud to have partnered and pioneered with China in this transformational endeavour,' he said.

He praised the BRI as 'a model of collaboration, partnership, connectivity and shared prosperity' amid growing geopolitical uncertainty, trade restrictions and inequalities.

Despite greater participation of world leaders in the second edition of the BRF, and Italy, a G-7 member country lately joining the BRI, the Chinese project is increasingly coming under criticism because of economic implications for countries participating in it and widening trade imbalances between China and the BRI partners.

Addressing those concerns, Chinese President Xi Jinping in his key note address said: 'China will take a series of major reform and opening-up measures and make stronger institutional and structural moves to boost higher quality opening-up.'

It was expected that China would use the gathering to address global concerns about the project. The Islamabad Policy Institute, a think tank in its report titled 'BRI and CPEC: Venturing into the Future', published on the eve of the BRF, noted that the meeting was expected to 'yield a number of inter-governmental agreements and projects involving the private sector'. It said China would on this occasion seek 'a cooperation framework' under which it would strengthen bilateral cooperation with individual BRI partners, encourage trilateral cooperation in BRI projects by bringing in third partners in bilateral projects and persuading the BRI partners to cooperate in third markets and increase cooperation with multilateral financial institutions.

CPEC: Prime Minister Khan recapped the progress made under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), considered the flagship project of BRI.

'Pakistan's energy supplies have increased massively. Our critical infrastructure gaps are being plugged. Gwadar, once a small fishing village, is transforming rapidly into a commercial hub. The Gwadar airport will be the largest in the country,' he said.

About the next phase of the CPEC on which the two countries are set to embark, Mr Khan said it would be characterised by 'greater emphasis on socio-economic uplift, poverty alleviation, agricultural cooperation and industrial development'.

He mentioned increasing cooperation between Pakistan and China in the fields of education, innovation and technology, the upcoming special economic zones with investment opportunities for Pakistani, Chinese and foreign entrepreneurs and the expanded Pakistan-China Free Trade Agreement that the two countries would be signing on the sidelines of the BRF.

'I take this opportunity to invite all of you to avail of our liberal foreign investment regime and participate in our economy, in particular infrastructure, railways, dams, IT and manufacturing,' the prime minister said.

Meetings

Prime Minister Khan held meetings with International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde, World Bank's Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva and Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon.

Mr Khan and Ms Lagarde underscored the importance of the fund programme and committed to working together for an agreement for which the IMF's delegation would shortly visit Islamabad.

A statement issued by PM Office said: 'The meeting reviewed the relationship between Pakistan and the Fund. The prime minister identified the areas of reform and initiatives being undertaken by the government to stabilise the economy, control inflation and achieve fiscal balance.'

The two sides, the statement said, agreed on the need for a social safety net for vulnerable groups of society.

Mr Khan also spoke at a luncheon hosted by the China-Pakistan Friendship Association and International Cultural Communication Centre and attended a banquet hosted by President Xi in honour of leaders attending the BRF.

Pakistan and China agreed on Friday to revive cooperation between the Chinese Investment Promotion Agency (CIPA) and the Board of Investment (BoI) to ensure investment promotion in prioritised sectors of information technology, textiles and agro-based products.

BoI Chairman Haroon Sharif, who is in Beijing as part of prime minister's delegation to participate in the second Belt and Road Forum, met Liu Dianxun, Director-General of Investment Promotion Agency of the Chinese ministry of commerce, and discussed the revival of a memorandum of understanding signed between BoI and CIPA in the past. Both sides agreed to revive the cooperation.

Mr Sharif informed CIPA Chief Dianxun that BoI would encourage Chinese investors for investment as Pakistan was planning to develop new special economic zones in addition to already notified seven special economic zones.

'The development of Rashakai special economic zones is a milestone and a first step towards implementation of industrial cooperation under CPEC. Industrial cooperation was prioritised by the present government with a goal to start implementation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) this year,' Mr Sharif informed his Chinese counterpart.

He said that BOI had received concrete investment proposals from local and foreign investors who were interested in investing in Pakistan's priority sectors having immense potential for investment; agro-based food and industry, value-added textile, tourism and hospitality, information technology sector, light engineering, and logistics.

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday urged for the creation of a tourism corridor between member countries of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in order to promote regional connectivity.

While addressing a leaders' round table conference in China, the prime minister congratulated President Xi Jinping on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and said that China is an example of "a great success of the modern age".

He suggested that members of the BRI should:

Develop programmes for improving the skills of labour from labour-surplus countries to assist the labour-deficient countries.

Create multi-lingual digital platforms for connecting producers, consumers, and skilled job-seekers.

While explaining to the members of the conference the ties Pakistan and China have cultivated through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he said that "to further boost connectivity and benefits under the Belt Road Initiative's umbrella" digital connectivity amongst member countries is key.

The other areas stressed by the premier to strengthen the ties formed through the BRI included mobility of labour, cultivation of cultural links and connectivity through knowledge and innovation.

Imran said the connectivity of Gwadar Port with China's Xinjiang region will "provide a shorter route for China's imports compared to the South China Sea, reduce the cost for Chinese companies, and develop western China as well".

He emphasised that "CPEC is not a transaction. It is a transformation of our society."

On Friday, in his speech at the inaugural session of the second Belt and Road Forum (BRF) in Beijing, Prime Minister Imran had said: 'As the Belt and Road Initiative takes a further concrete shape, I suggest we direct our efforts and focus on the peoples of our countries, and towards addressing impediments on their way to sustainable growth'.

 BRI : a historic opportunity

CHINA'S President Xi Jinping hosted the Second Belt and Road Forum in Beijing on April 26/27 125 countries and 40 international organisations have joined the Belt and Road Initiative. The BRI is an enormously ambitious project which envisages the linkage of the entire Eurasian mega-continent, and its near and far periphery in Southeast, ­South and West Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America, through interconnected land and sea infra­structure, trade and investment.

Thirty-seven heads of state and government, scores of ministers and 5,000 delegates participated in the Forum, reflecting the growing endorsement of the BRI. This acceptance reflects a desire among developing countries to emulate the successful 'model' of China's economic development and a recognition that it can provide an invaluable path towards global economic growth, greater ­prosperity and peace and stability in developing countries.

Reportedly, 175 agreements have been signed under the rubric of the BRI. Projects amounting to $90 billion have been implemented. The planned outlay on infrastructure projects is $1 trillion. This figure is likely to increase as non-Chinese sources of official finance and private sector finance join in funding BRI projects. The scope of the concept now envisages incorporation of various forms of ­cooperation such as the digital economy, e-commerce and creation of a BR Studies Network linking think tanks.

Not one of America's Asian allies has the stomach to confront China, their largest trading partner.

The US has declared its opposition to the BRI and sponsored a political and media campaign to discourage developing countries and its allies from joining it. The US and Western refrain of China's so-called debt-trap diplomacy, stories of corruption and failed projects have been repeated as nauseam although the basis for such reports has been credibly refuted by the parties concerned.

The admonitions regarding the debt owed to China are particularly galling given that over 90 per cent of developing country debt is owed to Western countries and institutions. Servicing this debt consumes around 30pc of annual hard currency outflows from these developing countries. This debt is due to flawed Western development 'aid' which has contributed only marginally to the development of recipient countries.

The US opposition has a strategic rationale. The initiative trumps the US aim of creating a ring of alliances around China's periphery and maintaining its domination of the 'India-Pacific'. The US has yet to acknowledge this is a losing battle.

Not one of America's Asian allies has the stomach to confront China, their largest trading partner. India has declared it values economic cooperation with China. Japan and Australia have stopped joining the US Navy in 'freedom of navigation' operations in the South China Sea. Miffed by US tariffs, Japan has joined the BRI as a 'third party'. A Japan-China Fund has been set up to co-invest in BRI projects.

Seventeen Central European countries have formed a group with China to promote economic cooperation including connectivity projects. Italy was the first G7 country to officially join the BRI. Even others, like the UK, France and Germany, who feel compelled by their alliance with the US to critique the BRI, are availing of every commercial opportunity emanating from China's economic expansion and the BRI.

America's own companies are unwilling to heed the official boycott. Over 150,000 US companies are operating within the Chinese economy. Only a handful are likely to move out. China's further 'opening up' is likely to further reinforce the interdependence of the world's two largest economies.

Pakistan hosts BRI's flagship component. Prime Minister Imran Khan was one of only seven leaders requested to address the summit. He called the BRI a 'model of collaboration, partnership, ­connectivity and shared prosperity' and 'a new and distinct phase along the path of globalisation'. CPEC is now the principal vehicle for intensification of bilateral ties. Of the $1tr allocated by China to BRI projects, $72bn is envisaged for CPEC. Of the $90bn invested so far, around $27bn was in Pakistan.

China values its 'strategic partnership' with Pakistan and recognises the imperative of ensuring its security, stability and development. The level of mutual trust between them is unparalleled. Its cooperation is essential to ensure Pakistan's ability to maintain credible deterrence against India and to stabilise Afghanistan after US withdrawal. If India is ever amenable to normalising ties with Pakistan, China's, and perhaps Russia's, intermediation may prove more advantageous than America's.

The opportunity for Pakistan in China is more compelling. China is supporting Pakistan's infrastructure development and industrialisation. It can be a growing market for Pakistan's exports. Pakistan must aim not only to emulate the path of China's growth but to improve on it, by learning from its successes and failures. Pakistan's aim should be not so much to 'catch up' as to 'leapfrog' into the 21st-century economy. In its cooperation, Pakistan should not seek the technologies of the past or present but those of the future which China is now introducing and applying: high speed rail (not old systems), AI, electric vehicles, environment-friendly energy, e-commerce, etc.

Pakistan needs to be well organised. Islamabad must identify what it wants and needs from China and formulate a strategy of how to achieve it. Such a strategy will need to be coordinated with China at the policy, operational and execution levels. Pakistan must deploy the best available technical and administrative expertise from the private or public sector, from within and outside Pakistan in each area of cooperation. The creation of an autonomous CPEC Authority would be useful to achieve the planned outcomes.

In an environment of great power rivalry, there must be strategic clarity in Islamabad. India's enmity is a constant; after elections, it may be reduced to hostility or, at best, rivalry. The US South Asia strategy is predicated on India's regional domination. There can be no wishful thinking that this can be changed by expressions of goodwill or clever diplomacy. The only way the US will treat Pakistan equitably is if it sees attractive economic opportunities in Pakistan. For this, Pakistan needs China's cooperation.

Pakistan's best choice now is to 'tie itself to China with hoops of steel', as proposed by the then foreign secretary S.K. Dehlavi in 1962. It would be tragic if we turn away from history's beckoning ­finger once again.

Prime Minister Imran Khan met Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Sunday, the last day of his four-day official visit.

Prior to his meeting with President Xi, the prime minister and his delegation met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and discussed bilateral issues and regional matters. Delegation-level talks were held with both Chinese leaders.

A diplomat speaking to Dawn earlier said that the discussions between Prime Minister Imran and President Xi will be very specific about what has to be done by the two countries under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). He added that industrial cooperation would be the most important element of the next stage of CPEC.

Prime Minister Imran and Premier Keqiang also signed the Main Line-1 railways agreement today, Radio Pakistan reported.

Under the project, a double railway track will be laid from Peshawar to Karachi. The speed of trains on the new track will be around 160 kilometres per hour, according to Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid.

After his meetings with Chinese leadership, the prime minister attended the Pak-China Trade Investment Forum.

Meeting with President Xi

Prime Minister Imran Khan met President Xi accompanied by ministers and a senior-level delegation. Reaffirming the 'All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership' between Pakistan and China, the two leaders exchanged views on the entire gamut of bilateral relations in a warm and cordial atmosphere, stated a press release issued by the prime minister's spokesperson.

They affirmed the resolve to further strengthen their strategic cooperative partnership in all fields including political, security, economic and trade, and people-to-people exchanges.

Prime Minister Imran Khan thanked President Xi for the warm and gracious welcome accorded to him in China, and for China's steadfast support to Pakistan on all issues.

The prime minister also reaffirmed Pakistan's support to China on all issues of its core interest and congratulated President Xi on the successful convening of the 2nd BRF, which the press release described as a "practical manifestation of his [Xi's] far-reaching vision", and highlighted its significance as an important international platform for connectivity and sharing of experience among the BRI participating countries.

He reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to CPEC and highlighted the foray into new areas of agriculture, industrial development and socioeconomic uplift in the next phase of the project.

President Xi Jinping reiterated China's unwavering support to Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity and appreciated the government's agenda for socioeconomic development and people-centred progress. He affirmed that China-Pakistan ties would continue to acquire greater strength and deepen practical cooperation in the time to come, the statement said.

The two sides also exchanged views on the regional situation, including in Afghanistan and South Asia. President Xi further expressed China's appreciation for Pakistan's sustained and successful efforts in the fight against terrorism and to create a peaceful neighbourhood.

Both sides expressed satisfaction over the close cooperation between the two countries at multilateral fora and resolved to further deepen communication and coordination at all levels.

They also agreed to keep the momentum of high-level exchanges between the two countries.

Meeting with Premier Keqiang

Ministers and senior officials participated in the meeting between Prime Minister Imran and Premier Li at the conclusion of the BRF.

Both leaders reaffirmed the time-tested and strong friendship between Pakistan and China and exchanged views on the myriad facets of bilateral engagement, a statement from the prime minister's spokesperson said.

The two sides exchanged views on bilateral collaboration in the context of CPEC and prospects of further deepening economic linkages.

The prime minister underscored the importance of CPEC for Pakistan's economy and noted with satisfaction its expansion into new areas of development - including industrial development; livelihood projects; social uplift; and agriculture in line with the priorities of government. He hoped that Chinese investment in SEZs would expand Pakistan's industrial base and assist in diversifying its export basket, the statement said.

Underlining the steady growth of bilateral cooperation since the prime minister's last visit to China in November 2018, Premier Li Keqiang expressed satisfaction at the positive momentum of CPEC projects.

He hoped that the conclusion of the 2nd phase of the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement (FTA), would further boost trade and economic relations between the two countries.

The two sides agreed to further deepen the political, security, economic, education, science and technology, cultural, and people-to-people relations. They also agreed to maintain the existing momentum of high level exchanges between the two countries.

A signing ceremony for the second phase of the FTA was held, in which the following MoUs/agreements were signed/exchanged:

Second phase of China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement

Declaration for completion of preliminary design of Phase-I for upgradation of ML-1 and establishment of Havelian Dry Port under CPEC

MoU on cooperation in the field of marine sciences between the China Geological Survey (CGS), Ministry of Natural Resources of China, the Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Science and Technology

MoU between CIDCA and Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform on implementation of the projects under the joint working group of CPEC on socioeconomic development

China-Pakistan Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement

Rashakai SEZ joint venture and license agreement between KPEZMDC and CRBC

'Pakistan is the future'

Later in the day, Prime Minister Imran addressed a lunch held by the Pak-China Trade Investment Forum in his honour.

The premier lauded the 2nd Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing, saying that he believes it has "become much more than the Chinese leadership had imagined".

Referring to his keynote address to the forum, in which he touched upon tackling climate change and other socioeconomic issues, the prime minister said that Pakistan is among the countries "taking revolutionary steps" in this regard.

Talking about his meeting with President Xi, he said, "I am happy we talked about getting help from China in science and technology. We want to establish an elite university for eight subjects where china has excelled."

The premier said that peace in Afghanistan would help facilitate increased connectivity between Pakistan and Central Asia. He also touched upon ties with India and hoped for better relations after the Indian election concludes.

"Pakistan is the future," he told investors at the event, assuring them of ease in investing and doing business in the country.

'Next stage of CPEC'

Prime Minister Imran began the bilateral component of his trip to China with a meeting with Vice President Wang Qishan in which he was accompanied by his delegation.

The bilateral discussions are focused on the next stage of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor in which the Chinese government has agreed to adjust the project according to the priorities of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government, which assumed office last year after the general elections.

In what is being described as the 'next stage of CPEC', industrial cooperation in the shape of development of special economic zones would come into spotlight and private sector investment and joint ventures would be encouraged.

In an interview with Radio Pakistan, Deputy Chief of Mission of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, Lijian Zhao, said that nine areas have been identified for developing SEZs across Pakistan, with the Rashakai, Quaid-i-Azam Industrial Park and Dhabeji SEZs being top priorities. He expressed confidence that groundbreaking on the Rashakai SEZ will be performed soon after the prime minister returns from his trip to China.

Beijing will, in the next stage of CPEC, also commit to social sector cooperation for which it will be investing $1 billion in 27 education, health, agriculture, water and irrigation, human resource development and poverty alleviation projects. An agreement on social sector cooperation will be signed during PM Khan's visit.

Moreover, the second stage Pak-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will also be signed under which China will open up 90 per cent of its market for Pakistani goods in an effort to address trade imbalance. Pakistan's trade deficit with China last year stood at $9.7bn. China, the largest trade partner of Pakistan, was then exporting goods worth $11.458bn to Pakistan while Pakistani exports to China were valued at $1.744bn.

It is estimated that the new FTA would increase Pakistani exports by $500 million. The agreement is being concluded after protracted negotiations spanning over nearly seven years.


 
 

Pakistan,  China  enter second stage of free trade

Pakistan and China on Sunday embarked on the new phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor by signing memoranda of understanding (MoUs) on the first Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and socio-economic development and a new agreement on free trade.

The MoUs and the second stage Free Trade Agreement (FTA) were signed towards the conclusion of Prime Minister Imran Khan's second trip to China in six months.

The prime minister's latest visit to Beijing was for attending the second Belt and Road Forum and talks with the Chinese leadership on the expanded CPEC. The earlier visit was more about the future course of the CPEC after the change of government in Pakistan and soliciting Beijing's help for dealing with the balance of payments crisis.

Beijing to spend $1bn on 27 projects, help Pakistan Railways upgrade its capacity

PM Khan in his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping assured him of Pakistan's 'unflinching commitment' to the CPEC and hailed its next phase, which includes newer areas like agriculture, industrial development and socio-economic uplift with livelihood projects.

The contours of the second phase of the CPEC have been finalised in view of priorities of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government related to socio-economic projects, greater involvement of the private sector and jobs creation.

President Xi appreciated Pakistan government's agenda for socio-economic development and people-centred progress, the PM Office said.

The new phase of the CPEC would be characterised by industrialisation. The first Special Economic Zone comprising 20 factories is being set up in Rashakai, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The Rashakai SEZ Joint Venture and Licence Agreement was signed between the KP Economic Zones Development and Management Company and the China Road and Bridge Corporation.

Further progress on SEZs would depend on how the Rashakai project progresses. In the next stage, Chinese are planning to cooperate with Pakistan for setting up of a heavy industry SEZ in Dhabeji (Sindh) and a hi-tech SEZ in Islamabad. Chinese investors are, meanwhile, also signing up joint ventures in a local SEZ in Faisalabad.

In his meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, Imran Khan hoped that Chinese investment in the SEZs would expand Pakistan's industrial base and diversify its export basket.

The second most important MoU, signed by the two sides, was between the China International Development Cooperation Agency and Pakistan's Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms for implementation of the projects under Joint Working Group of the CPEC on socio-economic development. The projects in education, health, human resource development, poverty alleviation, agriculture, and water and irrigation sectors are being sponsored by the Chinese government for which Beijing would spend $1 billion. Twenty seven projects have been identified by the two governments. The PTI government had placed a special emphasis on this element of cooperation.

In view of trade being an important element of the CPEC, the two sides concluded the second stage the Free Trade Agreement. The new FTA, which was signed after negotiations spanning over seven years, is aimed at strengthening trade ties. Under the new FTA, China would open up 90 per cent of its market for Pakistani goods whereas Pakistan would share 65pc of its market with Chinese exports. This would also help in redressing, to a certain extent, the yawning trade imbalance between the two countries, which stood at $9.7 billion last year.

Premier Li hoped that the conclusion of the second phase of China-Pakistan FTA would give further boost to trade and economic relations between the two countries.

The two sides also signed an agreement on a technical package for upgradation of Pakistan's main railway line ML-1.

On completion of ML-1, the Pakistan Railways will benefit in terms of increase in speed from 65km per hour to105km per hour to 120km/h to 160 km/h, increase in line capacity from 34 to 171 trains each way per day, increase in freight volumes from six to 35 million tons per year by 2025, increase in passenger trains from 20 to 40 each way per day and increase in railway share of freight transport volume from the current less than 4pc to 20pc.

Under the next phase of the agreement, the ministry of railways and the National Railway Administration of China will jointly start the construction work on the project. Prior to start of work, the final cost of the project would be worked out and agreement of financing would be finalised after considering the available options for financing, a spokesperson of the ministry of railways explained.

The signing of the 'Declaration for Preliminary Design' for completion of the first phase of Pakistan Railways' existing mainline (ML-1) has laid the foundation of cooperation between Pakistan and China in the railways sector.

Other agreements signed during PM Khan's visit were on setting up of a dry port at Havelian, economic and technical cooperation and cooperation in the field of marine sciences.

Geo-politics

President Xi, during his meeting with Mr Khan, reiterated China's unwavering support to Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

He expressed China's appreciation for Pakistan's sustained and successful efforts in the fight against terrorism and creating a peaceful neighbourhood.

'Both sides expressed satisfaction over the close cooperation between the two countries at multilateral fora and resolved to further deepen communication and coordination at all levels,' the PMO said.

During the meeting between PM Khan and Prime Minister Li, the two sides agreed to further deepen political, security, economic, education, science and technology, cultural and people-to-people relations.

 Belt and Road Initiative

THAT China has transformed itself from a socialist giant into an economic powerhouse of the 21st century is not news.

However, what is noteworthy is the fact it now seeks to become a global player through its Belt and Road Initiative an economic superhighway linking continents and cultures with China at the heart of the project.

And as interest from a growing number of countries has shown, the BRI could play a key role in shaping the socioeconomic and sociopolitical future of Eurasia and beyond.

The fact that 37 heads of state and government including Prime Minister Imran Khan attended the just concluded second Belt and Road Forum in Beijing proves that a growing number of states are seeking to jump on the BRI bandwagon and grab a slice of the pie.

It is indeed a massive initiative, envisioning an integrated network stretching from the shores of the Pacific to the heart of Europe, while extending to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.

And CPEC is one of the key nodes of this network, reflecting both on the positive Pakistan-China relationship, as well as this country's potential as a hub for regional trade and commerce.

However, while the BRI may hold immense potential for the regional, and indeed the global, economy, the projects under its umbrella must be transparent, and the benefits mutual to both China and the partner countries.

There have been accusations of Beijing practising 'debt-trap diplomacy' by 'drowning' partner states in debt.

There is evidence of Sri Lanka having problems with Chinese debt in a port project, while Malaysia under Mahathir Mohamed has renegotiated a rail project with Beijing on reportedly better terms.

To allay fears such, China and partner governments in the BRI must ensure that the terms of the projects involved are clearly understood and transparent.

In Pakistan's case, there has also been criticism that the benefits of CPEC are not trickling down to all parts of the country. For CPEC to be a success, its fruits must reach all provinces, while Pakistan's economy must benefit from the project in the long term.

Under the vision of functionalism and regional integration, the dynamics of international relations have been transformed.

For example, from the ashes of old Europe rose the European Union, in which former foes discarded their mutual animosity and worked for unprecedented integration.

However, while the EU project may be facing turbulence, regional cooperation under BRI can by interlocking economies be the harbinger of better ties and prosperity for the people of Eurasia and other regions falling under the project's ambit.

South Asia, for example, can gain from mutually rewarding BRI initiatives. Indeed others, especially the US and its allies, who are mostly critical of the BRI, must let this ambitious vision become a reality and work to establish a complementary relationship.


 
 

Inching towards equitable trade with  China

In pursuance of the new economic strategic direction, the PTI government hopes to cultivate a more intimate relationship with China focused on equitable trade and active collaboration for expanding the industrial base of Pakistan.

It also expects a greater degree of flexibility from China on the transparency of bilateral deals under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Members of the economic dream team of the government were not sure if they would succeed in winning over the Chinese to agree to grant more time for loan repayments, particularly for commercial loans.

According to our sources, the government is willing to offer an additional markup of one to two per cent in exchange for a three-year rollover. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reportedly made a three-year loan package of $6-8 billion conditional on the deferment of Chinese loan repayments.

According to reports, China has thus far injected $19bn for CPEC projects $13bn for private power projects and $6bn for 22 infrastructure projects. Government loans will be payable after five years, but the repayment for Chinese commercial loans is scheduled for mid-2019-20. Keeping the financial squeeze in sight, Chinese commercial loans were rolled over for one year during the current fiscal year.

Islamabad and Beijing have agreed to ensure electronic data exchange to curb under-invoicing as the bilateral trade statistics do not currently reconcile

A day before travelling to China with Prime Minister Imran Khan to attend the 2nd Belt and Road Forum, Adviser for Commerce, Textile and Investment Abdul Razak Dawood shared his optimistic thoughts on Islamabad-Beijing ties with Dawn over the phone.

'I am excited and going to Beijing with high hopes to get things moving for better outcomes for both the friendly countries. At the start of the next phase of collaboration, in the context of the CPEC, the focus will shift to industrial development and terms of trade that accrue greater benefits to Pakistan,' he asserted.

The adviser was confident that China was comfortable with Pakistan's compliance with the IMF's demand for greater transparency in CPEC projects. He dismissed the perception that former finance minister Asad Umar had turned down the IMF's request to share details of Pakistan's bilateral agreements, but capitulated to pressure and agreed to chop the defence budget to narrow the fiscal gap.

'I don't know the details of the IMF meeting. But I don't think there was any problem on the subject of information sharing. Mr Umar publicly said that we had passed on the information the multilateral lender asked for,' he said.

A source in the Ministry of Finance contested the adviser's view. He said the issue is still pending as under the confidentiality clause details of the country's bilateral agreements cannot be shared with any multilateral lender.

Mr Dawood declined to comment on the issue of the rollover of Chinese commercial loans. 'I am sorry, but I am not aware of developments on this count and not in a position to comment,' he said last Thursday.

He told Dawn that the team accompanying the prime minister this time around is well prepared. 'We have done extensive homework and have already agreed on better access to the gigantic Chinese market for a wide range of Pakistani products. The galloping China expects its imports to increase from current $2.1 trillion to $5tr by 2023. With exports to China totalling $1.8 billion, Pakistan's share is miniscule in the Chinese market. The duty-free access will place Pakistan on a par with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean),' he told Dawn.

He said the policy paper on Pakistan-China ties has been approved by the cabinet that met earlier in the week. He expected the revised Free Trade Agreement (FTA) would become operational by July. It contains safeguard measures against the import of those products from China that hurt local industry.

He said the two sides have also agreed in principle to the electronic data exchange transfer to curb misdeclaration and under-invoicing. Currently, trade data of the two countries does not reconcile. The volume and valuation of Chinese exports to Pakistan are higher than imports from China reported in Pakistan.

Most FTAs that Pakistan signed over the past 20 years are perceived as flawed because they opened up Pakistan's market without the country getting reciprocal access to partner nations. Business forums say the agreements hurt the local industry, partially blaming them for the erosion of whatever little industrial base the country had.

To move away from a trade-based consumption-oriented economy, the private sector and its think tanks such as the Pakistan Business Council have long been demanding that trade deals should be revised to allow sufficient space for the local industry to stabilise and expand.

K-Electric has planned to set up a 700MW power project with the assistance of a Chinese engineering firm calling it a milestone project in the economic cooperation bet­ween China and Pakistan. The project it said would directly benefit the country's economic hub and 'meet the growing power demand of Karachi and its adjoining areas'. In a statement issued here on Monday K-Electric announced that it had recently signed an agreement with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) to establish a state-of-the-art 700MW IPP-based power project at Port Qasim. The project was formally announced at the Pakistan Trade and Investment Forum held alongside the second Belt and Road Forum in Beijing the statement said.

 Read: Imran asks Chinese entrepreneurs to shift industries to CPEC special zones It said the project agreement and contracts were signed by K-Electric chief executive officer Moonis Alvi and CMEC chairman Zhang Chun in the presence of Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce and Industry Abdul Razak Dawood. 'I am sure that this is just one of a series of joint endeavours in the future that will translate into a win-win for shared prosperity in the region and beyond ' the statement quoted Mr Dawood as saying. 'Stable electricity supply infrastructure is critical for the country's sustainable progress trade and industries and I urge all stakeholders to work together for its early completion to maximise the benefits to Karachi and Pakistan.' The statement said the project was being developed under an IPP mode structure with K-Electric as the single off-taker.

KE holds equity share in this IPP whereas CMEC is both an equity partner and EPC (engineering procurement and construction) contractor. The power project already has an approved tariff from the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority whereas the land for the project has been acquired in the Port Qasim area. Sharing his thoughts after signing the agreement the CMEC chairman described Pakistan as a land of opportunities with tremendous economic potential. 'We are delighted to be a part of this landmark occasion today and are confident about the role of this power plant in addressing Karachi's power needs and look forward to increased economic cooperation between China and Pakistan in future as well ' Mr Zhang said.

The K-Electric CEO said the current project was one more in a series of investments by KE to further strengthen the city's power infrastructure and brought the power utility yet another step closer to the company's long-term commitment to enabling Karachi to fulfil its economic potential. 'KE has invested more than $2.1 billion in infrastructure upgrades across the energy value chain over the last nine years and plans to invest $3bn over the next few years. We are committed to increasing power generation and upgrading Karachi's transmission and distribution network ' Mr Alvi said. The statement said the construction of the plant was expected to commence in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. Once the project came online it would not only help meet the growing power demand of Karachi and its adjoining areas but also allow KE to diversify its fuel mix it added.


 
 

New body proposed to maximise CPEC's potential

Sherry Rehman chairperson of the Senate Standing Committee on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) on Monday proposed forming a 'CPEC authority' to take advantage of opportunities offered by the huge project. Speaking at the Senate CPEC Committee and National Defence University's workshop on the lessons of developing a multi-partisan support for CPEC Ms Rehman said 'We must take ownership of planning and ensure the trickle-down benefits permeate across all provinces'. She said this could only be achieved if a CPEC authority which is either a part of the planning ministry or exists as an autonomous body is put into action. 'It must be made very clear that the challenge to maximising CPEC gains is from Pakistan not China.' The former federal minister underlined the need to focus on four Cs to maximise CPEC's potential: consensus coordination capacity and clarity.

 She said at the moment there appeared to be a lack of federal capacity to manage policy frameworks and execute the complex set of contractual structures needed for different types of investment models being utilised under CPEC platforms. A crucial factor that requires attention and is often neglected is the environmental aspect of CPEC she said.

'While President Xi Jinping has ensured that the Belt and Road Initiative would be 'green low-carbon circular and sustainable' Pakistan being the world's seventh most climate impacted country must start prioritising green energy development initiatives and build climate resilience especially since infrastructural and industrial growth takes away chunks of green acres and expose us to more air and marine pollution.' She also said there was a clear lack of coordination between government agencies and financing methods with provinces as well as private-sector facilitation. 'Confusion in communicating the ministry's plans are common and offer few tangible incentives for businesses to build projects that invest in training human capital.' The CPEC Committee in Senate Chairperson also said 'A higher commitment to transparency pertaining to coordination and contracts will assist CPEC advocates in Pakistan to identify gaps in both planning and investment roadmaps whether it be between provinces within Pakistan or between federal ministries or as joint venture projects.' 'President Xi has prioritised transparency but unfortunately our government has not. Right now there seems to be a lack of clarity in priorities and the sharing of contractual terms ' continued Rehman. The Vice-President of Pakistan Peoples Party further said 'Despite all this the consensus on realising the potential of this huge opportunity is clear in all parties and provinces. The government is unable to exercise its function of convening meetings to maintain the consensus in the midst of course corrections on priorities and sectors.'

In an effort to make Islamabad 'clean and green', the Senate Subcommittee on Climate Change on Tuesday launched a campaign to make Islamabad plastic-free by Aug 14.

The announcement was made by the chairman of the subcommittee Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed at a meeting at Comsats University.

During the meeting, the subcommittee sought support of the students and faculty for the cause.

He also announced that the committee would seek to finalise a landfill site for the disposal of garbage and waste in the capital besides field visits during Ramazan for cleaning nullahs and other sites in Islamabad which had been encroached.

He asked Comsats to prepare a media awareness plan to achieve the objective of clean and green Islamabad with the support of students, media, civil society and the citizens.

Senator Sayed referred to his recent visit to China where he said the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with CPEC as its flagship project would be 'Clean and green' Silk Road following announcement by President Xi Jinping with focus on 'green development.'

He said climate change was amongst Pakistan's biggest challenges which could only be met collectively above party lines.

The meeting at Comsats chalked out a work plan for the visit of various localities in Islamabad during Ramazan.

The subcommittee was informed that the plan to rid the environment of plastic would begin from the federal capital starting from the parliament building and then extending to government departments before the exercise was replicated in other cities.

During a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Climate Change last week, Secretary Climate Change Hassan Nasir Jamy said planning was underway to ban plastic bags in the capital from Aug 14.

Manufacturers of plastic bags and other items would use this time to switch to environment-friendly alternatives such as paper and bags made from cloth.

He informed the members that the ministry was particularly banning oxy-biodegradable, introduced into the local market eight years ago, which was as harmful as an ordinary plastic bags.

The meeting was informed that after reacting with elements, sunlight and oxygen, the oxy-biodegradable plastic bags disintegrated into tiniest pieces that could be consumed by humans and marine life.

A statement issued here said that the agreement was signed during Prime Minister Imran Khan's recent visit to China on the occasion of second Belt and Road Forum.

It said that Rashakai SEZ was the key milestone and the first project for implementation of industrial cooperation under CPEC. CRBC in collaboration with EZDMC plans to develop 1,000 acres of land as SEZ in Rashakai.

CRBC will market the zone to local and foreign investors. Rashakai SEZ will have industries like pharmaceutical, textile, food and beverages, steel and various engineering related industries. This initiative by the government of KP will provide direct and indirect job opportunities to 200,000 locals once the SEZ is fully colonised. Investment of multibillion rupees is expected by industrialists from Pakistan and abroad, while hundreds of online applications for the SEZ have already been received.

The statement said a formal groundbreaking ceremony would be held soon which will be attended by PM Imran Khan. The statement said CEO EZDMC Saeed Ahmed signed the concessional agreement with CRBC Chairman Lu Shan.

The signing ceremony was attended by PM Khan and Chinese PM Li Keiqiang apart from high-level delegations from Pakistan and China.

Mr Ahmed said: 'This is a major achievement and a game changer for the people of the region. The project will bring prosperity not only to KP but will also be a major hub for tax collection and exports contributing to the national economy.'

Students from different councils on Tuesday gathered outside the office of the vice chancellor of Punjab University to get the curtailed admission quota restored.

Around two dozen students from Baloch, Punjabi and Pukhtoon councils launched a protest against the administration for allegedly curtailing their admission quota given by the Punjab government in 2012.

The students also demanded concession in fee.

They said the government had given quota of per class one seat to the students of Balochistan and around 150 were able to get admission per annum.

They said the current administration had reduced the quota from one class to one programme as a result the number of seats reduced to 53.

They also demanded quashing FIRs against the students and restoring the rusticated students and evening classes [students] should be given 50 per cent concession in fee.

They also demanded action against the students of a religious party who allegedly tortured and kidnapped a member of Punjabi council.

They said they would also appeal to Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar to revive their admission quota in the university.

A number of security personnel and Punjab University Registrar Prof Khalid Khan with other administrative officials approached the students and asked them to end the sit-in.

The students later dispersed on the assurance of the administration after handing over their demand draft to them. They vowed to resume protest for not implementing their demands.

The PU registrar said the administration was implementing order of the government of one seat per programme.

He said the students could appeal to the discipline committee of the university against any punishment and it would review its decision.

He said the administration had issued notices to the students for violating and creating law and order problem on the campus and they would have to appear before the discipline committee to submit their reply.

BOOK LAUNCH: A ceremony to launch book titled 'One Belt One Road hands on small enterprises' written by Director General UMT Abid HK Sherwani, Dr. Hassnain Javed (PITAC) and Mr. CaiLi (China) held here at Pakistan Industrial Technical Assistance Center (PITAC).

This piece of writing has been published by UMT Press. The event was chaired by Adviser to Prime Minister on Commerce, Textile, Industry and Production and Investment Abdul Razak Dawood, Director General UMT Abid HK Sherwani, Adviser PITAC Dr Hasnain Javed, Rector UMT Dr. Muhammad Aslam, Pro-Rector UCP Dr. Nizamuddin.

The ceremony was also attended by many national and International scholars, writers, senior industrialists, media persons and students.

The book provides an overview and analysis of Pakistan's and China's small and medium enterprises and of the One Belt One Road initiative, focusing on how this venture opens up avenues for cross-border SMEs of the two countries.

This is for the first time that such a detailed analysis of SMEs in China has been done. One important lesson that emerges from this research is that Pakistan's industrialisation is possible under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project.


 
 

Future of Pak-US relations

PAKISTAN's long, close and turbulent relationship with the US has had a pervasive impact on this country's history. The last phase of that relationship, the 'war on terror' alliance, ended in August 2017, when Donald Trump announced a punitive policy towards Pakistan, suspending high-level contacts, freezing Coalition Support Funds repayments and demanding Pakistan's cooperation on Afghanistan.

Over the next 18 months, America's initially coercive demands on Afghanistan became progressively realistic, eventually asking Islamabad to help start direct talks between the US and the Afghan Taliban.

Pakistan has delivered on this request. Several rounds of US-Taliban talks, held mostly in Doha, have reportedly led to draft agreements for withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and to prevent Afghanistan's territory from being used as a base for global terrorism in future. However, the Taliban have refused to talk to what they call the 'puppet' government in Kabul or to accept a ceasefire until US troop withdrawal is under way.

The US has not offered Pakistan any tangible concessions in exchange for its assistance. Contrary to earlier assurances that Islamabad would have no responsibility for the talks' outcome, it is now asking that Pakistan play an important role in achieving a successful conclusion of the 'peace process'.

US demands have been extended to the eastern front. During and after the Pulwama mini-crisis, US pressure was ratcheted up directly and through the UN and the FATF to demand actions against the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad and the inclusion of JeM's Maulana Azhar on the UN Security Council's 'terrorism' list.

America's new hostility towards Pakistan is due mostly to its emerging global rivalry with China.

Islamabad has seen it in its own interest to comply with the demands to proscribe the activities of the LeT and JeM. It has also continued its cooperation on Afghanistan. However, this may not prove sufficient to restore friendly ties with the US.

America's new hostility towards Pakistan is due mostly to its emerging global rivalry with China, in which India has been chosen as Washington's strategic partner whereas Pakistan is listed on China's side of the power equation. The recently announced US South Asia Policy is predicated on India's regional domination.

If Pakistan is to establish an equitable relationship with the US, it will have to build the capability to resist India-US military, financial and domestic pressure. To do so, it needs strong and nationally-oriented governance and China's unreserved cooperation.

Pakistan is well placed to resist military pressure. The Pulwama mini-crisis demonstrated two things: one, that Pakistan can defend itself by conventional means; two, that nuclear deterrence worked once again to moderate military behaviour on both sides. Yet, India is embarked on a major arms acquisition and modernisation process which Pakistan will have to continue to neutralise if not match. Most importantly, Pakistan must disabuse India of any presumption that, under a US umbrella, it could 'test' Pakistan's nuclear deterrence or resort to a pre-emptive strike against Pakistan's strategic assets. A Pakistani 'second strike' capability will eliminate this danger.

Pakistan's financial defences are vulnerable. The nation needs to come together to implement the politically difficult yet vital tax and other measures required to ensure a sustained balance in the country's fiscal and external accounts. For the longer term, Pakistan should join the nascent efforts of China, Russia and some other countries to construct alternate or supplementary arrangements to the US-dominated financial system.

Likewise, Pakistan is not fully equipped to fight the 'hybrid' war being waged by India and others in Balochistan, ex-Fata, sections of the media and politics to destabilise the country domestically. Using all the tools of modern technology, Pakistan must develop a sophisticated intelligence, counter-insurgency and political action capability for defence.

'Defensive' measures do not imply systemic hostility with the US. There are vast areas for mutually beneficial cooperation which can be promoted as long as the US does not threaten Pakistan's core interests and positions, especially its rejection of Indian domination and support for Kashmiri self-determination.

Counterterrorism, regional arms control and global non-proliferation are identified issues for continued cooperation.

Trade and investment are the most promising areas to build a future Pakistan-US relationship. The US is Pakistan's prime export market. Pakistani exports are held back due to lack of competitive capacity. Pakistan's current industrialization drive should target production for exports to the huge US as well as Chinese and Asian markets.

Similarly, even though US official assistance to Pakistan will be minimal and conditional, Pakistan should make a concerted effort to invite US private investment into the vast and untapped economic opportunities that exist in almost every sector of the Pakistan economy, including the SEZs and the privatisation programme. Apart from finance, such investment will bring advanced management techniques and production technologies to Pakistan.

Pakistan and the US also agree that there are vast opportunities for regional economic cooperation and integration, although their respective regional priorities are not yet fully convergent.

Despite the new Cold War, the US may find it expedient to cooperate with China and Pakistan to stabilise the Afghan economy in a post-settlement scenario, including through Afghanistan's integration into CPEC, and collaborative execution of several agreed transnational projects, such as the TAPI and CASA-1000 ventures.

Pakistan's revived relationship with Saudi Arabia and the UAE offers another avenue for indirect economic Pakistan-US cooperation. Significantly, Saudi and UAE investments in the energy and petrochemicals sectors, besides potentially building Pakistan's bridges with US corporates, will also link them, via oil and gas exports, to China and Central Asia through Pakistan.

Hope resides in the possibility that the US will perceive the economic momentum in Asia, unleashed by the Belt and Road Initiative and Asian economic integration, as a strategic opportunity rather than a challenge. US participation could transform the Belt and Road endeavour into a globally beneficial enterprise.

Indeed, faced by global threats of climate change, poverty and nuclear annihilation, and offered the alternative of a cooperative, knowledge-driven future of growth and prosperity, the US, China, Russia and other powers, including India, ultimately would be wise to opt for 'win-win' cooperation rather than 'lose-lose' confrontation.

Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Wednesday called for collective efforts by Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states to meet present day challenges and achieve sustainable development, Radio Pakistan reported.

The foreign minister, while addressing a two-day SCO Council of Foreign Ministers' meeting in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, described the SCO as an important platform for the creation of linkages between countries in the region. He said Pakistan is determined to implement the SCO charter.

Qureshi said that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor would help promote further linkages in the region.

Condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, the foreign minister stressed the need for addressing the root causes of the problem. He informed participants that Pakistan is among the few countries that have been able to successfully counter terrorism and invited SCO members for a discussion on Pakistan's experiences and expertise in defeating the scourge.

The foreign minister said that Pakistan would continue to facilitate the Afghan peace process, emphasising that it is an initiative owned and led by the people of Afghanistan.

Qureshi stressed the importance of conflict resolution for peace and stability in South Asia, and said that Pakistan had delivered a message of peace by opening the Kartarpur Corridor for Sikh pilgrims.

Qureshi along with foreign ministers from other SCO member states met Kyrgyz President Sooronbay Jeenbekov in Bishkek.

The Kyrgyz president welcomed the foreign ministers and said it was matter of pride for his country to host the SCO meeting.

A well-placed FO source in Bishkek told DawnNewsTV that Qureshi and Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj, who had been standing next to each other in the hall, engaged in an informal exchange with each other.

Pakistan, Russia against weaponisation of space

Qureshi and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov signed a joint statement against the first placement of weapons in outer space.

The statement, signed on the sidelines of the moot, was described by the Foreign Office in a press release as a reflection of the convergence of views between the two sides.

"Pakistan and Russia share a common position on the prevention of arms race in outer space and work collectively in various international fora towards that goal. The signing of today's joint statement on 'No First Placement of Weapons in Outer Space' is a reflection of convergence of views between the two sides," the FO said.

"Pakistan and Russia have reiterated their commitment to refrain from the threat or use of force in outer space activities. We encourage other responsible space-faring nations to follow this example," the FO said.

The FO said Pakistan had consistently highlighted the risks from weaponisation of outer space as it threatens the long term sustainability of peaceful space activities.

"The use of force against space-based objects, the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems and their integration into space assets have added worrying dimensions to the issues relating to outer space," the statement said.

It further pointed out that there is an urgent need to address the gaps in the international legal regime governing the exploration and use of outer space.

The world needs to ensure "that no one threatens peaceful activities and applications of space technologies for socio-economic development," the statement said.

Qureshi meets Chinese FM

Also on Wednesday, Qureshi met his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of the Council of Foreign Ministers' meeting.

According to Associated Press of Pakistan, both sides exchanged views on bilateral relations, the security situation in the region and other important issues of mutual interest.

A Foreign Office statement said Qureshi described China as Pakistan's dearest friend and strongest ally in the meeting, and said that friendship with China is a cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign policy.

"Whether it's a matter of Pakistan's national security, or regional peace and stability, China has always played a significant role," Qureshi told Yi during the meeting.

He also congratulated the Chinese foreign minister on the success of the second Belt and Road Forum, saying that it was evidence of the international community's confidence in China's policies.

'Pak-Kazakh bilateral trade to increase'

Pakistan and Kazakhstan also agreed to enhance the volume of their bilateral trade to $1 billion, Radio Pakistan reported.

The understanding was reached during a meeting between Qureshi and the Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan, Beibut Atamkulov on the sidelines of the Council of Foreign Ministers' meeting.

Both the Foreign Ministers agreed to further expand their bilateral relations in diverse fields.


 
 

Towards CPEC 3.0

THE Belt and Road Initiative has attracted praise and critique since its inception in 2013. The response is not unnatural for the transnational endeavour could mobilise an investment of $1.3 trillion by 2027 and will potentially change the geo-economics of partner countries and regions. It remains to be seen, however, if BRI's architects will follow in the footsteps of Western hegemons or seek mutually beneficial partnerships.

The West, led by the US, is becoming more wary of China's bolstering economic muscle with every passing day. The country has faced more intense scrutiny since 2015 when it announced 'Made in China 2025', a plan to spearhead high-tech industrial development. Beijing presents it as an effort to circumvent the middle-income trap, but Western countries accuse it of mercantilism and subsidising Chinese firms heavily for a competitive edge over their Western rivals.

On the political front, Western strategists equate BRI with debt-trap diplomacy to sow the seeds of distrust. The accusation is ironically levelled by the architects and custodians of the Bretton Woods system. Besides, it emanates from a policy to limit China from playing an assertive role in the developing world, which may undermine the West's contemporary dominance. Pakistan the host of BRI's crown jewel, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has strategic ties with China, which both countries are striving to deepen further. Our analysts argue CPEC is a historic opportunity for Pakistan to leapfrog into the 21st century.

The success of CPEC is crucial for Beijing to place itself as a trusted partner for the Global South.

In this backdrop, it's barely noted that the corridor is now a test case for Beijing too to demonstrate its ability of becoming a trusted partner for the Global South. It is nonetheless incumbent on the Pakistani government to remain cognisant of channelling the benefits of CPEC towards our youth and poorer population. No matter how sincerely Beijing pursues CPEC, we cannot discount the fact that its own economic interests, not inherently exploitative though, would hold supreme, and we must realise that sooner rather than later.

As President Xi presses ahead with his flagship initiative and presents BRI as a common development goal, our decision-makers should aim to nurture a long-term partnership that yields equitable dividends. This necessitates an understanding of the needs of our economy for today and for tomorrow and prioritising the areas that hold all-out benefits. Likewise, Beijing must pursue economic ties with Islamabad based on the principles of transparency and shared prosperity, regardless of our much weaker economic might.

Despite some politicking regarding CPEC's initial priorities, it was carefully crafted because the provision of energy and transport infrastructure is a prerequisite for economic advancement. The second phase prioritises agriculture, digital connectivity, industry, tourism etc. As this economic integration accelerates, future collaboration, CPEC 3.0, should be manoeuvred towards high-tech sectors namely telecom, electric mobility and renewables, where China is an emerging global leader to optimise CPEC's benefits.

In the telecom industry, China's Huawei has become a leading equipment supplier and is among the world's most innovative companies with nearly 88,000 patents as of December 2018. Analysts believe it is set to lead the world in the rollout of the future's most promising, and critical, technology: fifth-generation (5G) mobile telecom infrastructure. As of April 2019, Huawei had signed more than 40 5G contracts globally, proving that the firm can commercialise its solutions faster than its Western and Asian rivals.

Many Chinese tech giants are already present in Pakistan. Since digital connectivity and infrastructure are essential for tomorrow's economies, future cooperation in this area should form a major pillar of CPEC. Regardless of the US government's fierce opposition, Chinese tech giants will be at the forefront of advancements in the telecom industry. Therefore, B2B partnerships could help Pakistan's budding ICT sector to develop capacities by engaging with Chinese partners. Meanwhile, Chinese firms can target the vast untapped potential of Pakistani market.

Concerned chiefly about its soaring dependence on imported fuels and worsening urban pollution challenges we can relate with the Chinese government implemented several corrective measures. Since taking the reins in 2013, President Xi has stressed the need for sustainability more than his predecessors. Resultantly, China is a leader in the renewables industry and the largest market for electric vehicles (EVs). According to Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, by December 2018 China had 181 gigawatt of wind and 175GW of solar PV capacity a whopping one-third of installations worldwide.

Although Western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) dominate the global wind turbine value chain, Chinese PV suppliers are rivalled by none, albeit facing anti-dumping duties by many countries. Chinese turbine OEMs have struggled to lure investors outside their domestic market, but thanks to CPEC, they hold a 30pc share in Pakistan's nascent wind energy market. Chinese turbine OEMs are willing to localise production for future installations, which can lay the foundation for tech transfer yet another incentive that sets renewables apart from thermal power.

China leads the world in emerging trends in e-mobility. It has over 200 million electric two-wheelers and recorded sales of 1m EVs in 2018 more than the rest of the world combined. According to McKinsey, a consultancy, the success of Chinese OEMs is more pronounced in the e-bus segment of the 97,000 urban buses sold in China in 2018, 87,000 were electric.

Beijing has a goal that one-fifth of vehicles sold in China by 2025 should be electric, which will catalyse exponential growth in EV sales and help Chinese manufacturers consolidate their strengths. Advancements in these sectors will create further synergies. For instance, 5G connectivity is necessary to commercialise autonomous EVs and robo-taxis, which will rely on artificial intelligence and fuelled (ideally) through renewables.

This is not to suggest that China will help us become an important player in these futuristic technologies. That thought is far-fetched. Nevertheless, by aiding Islamabad in these areas to address the economic and environmental challenges it faces, Beijing will vindicate President Xi's stated vision of BRI and legitimise its leadership in the developing world. Or else we must tone down the enthusiasm that encircles CPEC and reassess the allocation of our scarce institutional resources for better outcomes.

Mr Ganiev appreciated the role of the Pakistan Army in battling the scourge of terrorism in the country and for maintenance of peace and stability in the region.



 

Unsuspecting Pakistani brides

THE seeds of the problem were sown three decades ago. In the years following the Cultural Revolution, the People's Republic of China put into effect its one-child policy. Under its purview, every couple was limited to just one offspring. While the policy itself finally ended in 2015, its effects did not. First among these effects was selective abortion, as well as the alleged killing of infant girls seen as a burden rather than an asset to the family.

None of that is or should be news to Pakistanis, who often hear of cases of newborn girls being killed and their bodies thrown into garbage heaps in their own country.

The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report, 2018, showed the sex ratio in China as 0.94 female to one male. Not only is this a problem in numerical terms (the men who were born and grew up during the one-child policy era now need brides), it is also one in sociological terms. The same, mostly male, generation (instead of the natural 50:50 male-to-female ratio) is experiencing greater economic prosperity than ever before.

As relations between China and Pakistan have matured into unprecedented closeness, it seems that many Pakistani women have become unwittingly embroiled in a crisis that shows few signs of abating. In the past several months, reports have emerged of Pakistani women being married off to Chinese men and being sold into prostitution once they are in China.

The Chinese government must closely monitor Chinese men who pass through immigration with Pakistani wives.

In the most recent report that came to light last month, two girls, Samina and Tasawur Bibi, from Kot Momin in Sargodha district reported that their own poverty-stricken parents married them off to two Chinese men. The men said that they were Muslim and that they would keep the girls in Lahore and not take them to China. They also said that they would help their families start some businesses and improve their lives. None of this happened. When the girls got to Lahore, they reportedly found that the men were operating a brothel under the guise of a marriage bureau. The men had faked everything including their religion. Sadly, as we hear of many other cases, the story seems fairly typical though the details can vary.

The case of Rabia Kanwal that was reported in the New York Times involved a woman and her family who were lied to. Her husband said that he was Muslim and was a wealthy farmer. According to Ms Kanwal, she was then flown to China and ended up in Hunan province after a short stop in Urumqi in Xinjiang province. There she was surprised to find that her husband was not the wealthy man he had pretended to be but a poor duck farmer. Ms Kanwal said she wanted to leave, something she was eventually able to do with the help of the Pakistani embassy. When the Times talked to her husband, he said he was rich and claimed that he had only become Muslim on paper for the purposes of marrying her.

In yet another variation on trafficking, sometimes the women report actually being taken to China where they are sold into prostitution. Pakistani marriage brokers are also allegedly working and arranging marriages between girls of poor families and Chinese men who are coming to Pakistan to work on various projects. The men apparently stay in various rental properties until the marriage takes place and then leave with the women. In raids carried out by the FIA, several Chinese individuals have been arrested on charges of operating brothels or trafficking women.

In recent weeks, the media attention garnered by the issue has led Chinese officials to denounce allegations that Pakistani brides were being trafficked to China. Along with the statements, videos of Pakistani women married to Chinese men were released. In the videos, the women who may or may not have actually been married to the Chinese men declare in Urdu how happy they are. The men do not say anything at all but stay in the frame the entire time. Whether or not the videos are authentic, it is true that China's woman deficit has previously led to women being trafficked from other regional countries, such as Myanmar. In a statement, the rights watchdog Human Rights Watch also attested that the pattern of trafficking appeared to be very similar.

There is no doubt that the Chinese government needs to do much more to crack down on this problem by monitoring Chinese men who pass through immigration with Pakistani brides. At the same time, the Pakistani government and Pakistani society in general also need to give some serious thought to what they expect out of their exchange with China.

It is sad that closer relations between the two countries, with men from China coming to Pakistan to work on the Belt and Road Initiative, has created a situation where women find themselves vulnerable to trafficking. But it is not very surprising, given the fact that many of the Chinese workers come from a society where not everyone can marry (especially because of the shortage of women). The result of all this is the victimisation of unsuspecting Pakistani women.

Beyond the human trafficking dimension, Pakistanis also need to think long and hard about their terms of cultural exchange with China. It is quite one thing to accept Chinese money and laud Chinese projects, it is quite another to embrace a culture that is qualitatively different from Pakistan's own. Until now, this is probably the least considered aspect of Pakistan's turn towards China. Unless it is attended to, women will continue to bear the brunt of the two governments looking away every time they are exploited. It is about time that both governments worked together to come up with an effective strategy to stop this practice.


 
 

Pakistan rejects trade war with  China : senator

Pakistan rejects any trade war or cold war with China, said Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed.

He was speaking at the launch of a book on the leadership of President Xi Jinping, which was hosted by Pakistan-China Institute (PCI).

The US and China are locked in a trade row. The US last year imposed tariffs on Chinese imports worth billions of dollars, which Beijing retaliated. As the two were engaged in talks over tariffs and experts were hopeful of a deal, Washington more than doubled tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese products. Beijing again retaliated by hiking tariffs on US goods.

Mr Hussain said President Xi placed China at the centre stage of global politics by leading the struggle against climate change, supporting globalisation as well as launching the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of which CPEC is the flagship project.

He termed BRI the most important diplomatic and developmental initiative of the 21st century. He thanked China not just for supporting CPEC but also for providing strategic support to Pakistan at all international for a, including the UN Security Council, G-20 and the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

He termed CPEC a 'success story' and said the 'best of CPEC has yet to come' since its second phase has begun with the launch of special economic zones (SEZs).

Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing said Pakistan-China relations had stood the test of changing times and, in fact, this relationship today was more robust and resilient.

AJK President Masood Khan described China as Pakistan's 'best friend' and he said during his tenure as ambassador to Beijing he had personally witnessed how China supported Pakistan on all issues.

He also referred to CPEC projects in AJK which he said were very beneficial for the economy and employment in Azad Kashmir. He said the names of Chinese leaders such as Chairman Mao,Premier Zhou Enlai and President Xi were household names in Pakistan because of this special relationship between the two countries.

Former foreign minister Tariq Fatimi and former defence secretary retired Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik said despite efforts to undermine CPEC and Pakistan-China relations the relationship between the two neighbours was so strong and so deep that it would withstand all pressures of any kind from any quarters.


 
 

In a changing world

THIS week, India and Pakistan lost yet another opportunity to break the ice and initiate dialogue when the prime ministers of both countries attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Bishkek.

The incumbent Pakistani government has offered India an olive branch on many occasions, only to add to Indian intransigence. This further strengthens the perception that India's only present strategy is to isolate Pakistan diplomatically. In a changing world, India is determined to make it difficult for Pakistan to play a major role in emerging global and regional alliances. However, the deepening China-US trade battle and the threat of protectionism, among other factors, are influencing the political order in Asia too, where India is itself struggling to strategise its roles and alliances.

Pakistan's current dilemma is that, due to worsening economic and political crises, it finds itself constrained to play a proactive role in emerging regional geopolitics. The political capital it invested in Afghanistan has only earned it the role of influencing the Afghan Taliban to engage in peace talks. Past policies of supporting non-state actors proved counterproductive.

Pakistan is facing three immediate challenges on the foreign policy front. First, the growing US-Iran confrontation will not only drag Pakistan into the geopolitical turf of the region and Middle East but also test its ability to balance its ties with Saudi Arabia and Iran. Second, in the ongoing China-US trade war, Pakistan will also find it difficult to maintain a balance in its ties with these countries, even sustain a minimum level of engagement with the US. Third, and perhaps the biggest challenge, is that India appears set to add to Pakistan's difficulties, including through the use of the 'terrorism' pretext, to try to push it out of South Asia. Add the Afghanistan-India equation to this mix and the challenge is further complicated.

India is determined to undermine Pakistan's role in emerging global and regional alliances.

With India topping the list, the US has apparently already excluded Pakistan from its list of allies in South Asia. Recently, the media quoted a report released by the US Department of Defence that considered Pakistan an ally of China. Therefore, the report said, the US is ready to partner with all other South Asian nations except Pakistan to counter Chinese and Russian influences. With the exception of India, these do not have any significant political and strategic ambitions to connect strategically to the US; their need for economic engagement with the US also does not come with strings attached. Pakistan and the US have had a complicated relationship for decades, which are unique in many contexts, but it has currently been put to a huge test.

US actions in South Asia are certain to be led by its strategic alliance with India, which wants to isolate Pakistan at any cost. The so-called Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, which is projected as an alternative to Saarc, is India's attempt to push Pakistan out of South Asian geo-economics and geopolitics. However, it remains to be seen how India can make it effective as it is already facing problems. Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Nepal have recalibrated their relationships with China in order to diversify their geo-economic options.

Pakistan's three key challenges are not linear, but manifold and complex. Besides having implications for Pakistan's internal security and economy, these challenges also make it difficult for the country to navigate the turbulent regional geo-economics and effectively set its future political and strategic direction.

If the Indian hunt and the US pressure continue, Pakistan will be forced to navigate its geopolitical direction towards countries in its west and north, which are rife with conflicts. The geo-economic prospects of these countries from Iran and Afghanistan to Central Asian nations are not enviable due to a variety of security and politico-economic reasons. The entire region's political stability is linked with the realisation of transnational energy projects like Tapi and IP, which can create interdependencies among them at a level where misadventures become costlier. Pakistan's strengths in such projects are linked to its being an end-user and transit country for energy projects, as well as a source of security through facilitating peace negotiations with the Afghan Taliban.

On a certain level, many in Pakistan have desired a northwest drift in the country's foreign relations on the grounds of identity and ideological roots. With a deepening engagement with China and some Middle Eastern nations, a new segment of the power elites is growing in strength which is not as pro-West as traditional power elites have been. There are also voices within important institutions that support a broader engagement with the free world, call for resolving problems with neighbouring countries peacefully, and that want an enhanced focus on the country's economic, social and scientific strengths.

Objectively speaking, Pakistan has enormous opportunities to form geo-economic blocs in its northwest. For one, the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation has the potential to be converted into an effective geo-economic partnership. The Carec programme is a partnership of 11 countries (Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), whose long-term vision is: 'Good Neighbours, Good Partners, Good Prospects'.

Notwithstanding developments in its northwest, Pakistan should not allow itself to be forced out of South Asia, which not only has enormous trade and connectivity potential but also extreme strategic significance for the country. China also sees more potential in connecting CPEC to South Asia because it believes that CPEC's growth potential would be much higher if connected with this region than with Pakistan's conflict-ridden northwest. China also thinks that economic and trade connectivity in South Asia will reduce regional tensions.

But China will have to invest more in reducing tensions in South Asia if it wants to maximise the advantages of the BRI and CPEC initiatives. China's proactive diplomatic role to reduce tension between India and Pakistan will benefit it most. Geo-economic advantages cannot be maximised without investing in geopolitics.


 
 

COMMENT: Xinjiang: a sweet and peaceful homeland for people of all ethnic groups

XINJIANG is the nearest place of China to Pakistan. When we say that 'Sino-Pakistan friendship is higher than mountains', it refers to the Karakoram mountains between Xinjiang and Pakistan. As the starting point for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and a hub of the 'Belt and Road' Initiative, Xinjiang offers unprecedented opportunities for development.

From 1978 to 2018, Xinjiang has made great improvement in people's living standards. The GDP of Xinjiang increased from 3.9 billion yuan to 1.15 trillion yuan ($1,686 billion) and the per capita GDP increased from 313 yuan to 48,000 yuan ($7000), an increase of 294 times and 153 times, respectively.

Tourism has become an important engine for high-quality development. Last year, the number of domestic and international tourists in Xinjiang exceeded 150 million, an increase of more than 40 per cent.

The greatest charm of Xinjiang lies in the multi-ethnic harmony and diversity in cultures. There are 25,000 places for religious activities, including 24,400 mosques. On average, there is one mosque for every 530 Muslims.

Xinjiang has a population of 25 million and hosts all 56 ethnic groups in China such as Uighur, Han, Kazakh, Hui, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Tajik, etc. The minority population accounts for 59.9 per cent of the total population. The people of all ethnic groups hold together like pomegranate seeds, cherishing national unity as much as their own lives.

The remarkable economic and social development that Xinjiang has achieved attributed to the policy of the Chinese government in firmly cracking down on terrorism and safeguarding social stability.

Since the 1990s, terrorists, extremists and separatists inside and outside China have planned and organised thousands of violent terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, resulting in a large number of casualties of innocent people of all ethnic groups.

Among these attacks are some notorious cases. On July 5, 2009, mobs attacked the city of Urumqi, causing 197 deaths and more than 1,700 injuries. At that time, Xinjiang was on the verge of being swallowed by terrorism.

By combining anti-terrorism experience of the international community with the ground situation, the Chinese government has taken a series of deradicalisation measures, including establishing vocational training centres. Lessons on official language of China, Chinese laws, vocational training and deradicalisation were offered for free so that trainees can master a skill and achieve self-reliance after the training.

During the training, customs and habits of different ethnic groups and different religions are respected. After the training is completed, trainees are recommended for jobs in local enterprises.

Deradicalisation in Xinjiang has been proven effective with remarkable outcomes. For nearly three years, no violent terrorist attacks have taken place in Xinjiang. The number of criminal and public security cases also decreased sharply, and the infiltration of extremism has been effectively curbed.

Today Xinjiang is not only as beautiful as it used to be, but also much safer. It becomes a beautiful home for people of all ethnic groups to live and work in peace.

Despite all the development in Xinjiang, in the past few months, there have been some noises by Western media. Some attacked the training centres as 'prisons' or 'concentration camps', which 'seriously violated human rights'.

Among those who making noise, there are those who have never been to Xinjiang, their allegation is based on rumour or imagination; some having hidden motives intentionally twist the truth to discredit China or provoke conflict between China and Muslim countries by linking the effort of Chinese government for maintaining social stability with 'religion repression'.

For those who do not have a chance to know what is happening in Xinjiang, they are welcome to visit the province and see the truth with their own eyes. Recently, representatives from international organisations, including the UN, OIC, government officials and media groups from Pakistan, Malaysia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and some other countries visited Xinjiang and met the trainees face to face. They witnessed how local Muslims lived and worked in peace and fully enjoy freedom of religion.

They highly appreciated the ethnic and religious policies of China, and firmly supported China's preventive anti-terrorism and deradicalisation efforts. For those who pretend to be asleep, we know that they can never be awakened. We believe that facts speak louder than words, while lies cannot hide the truth.

Pakistan has long been disturbed by terrorism. Under the joint efforts of the Pakistan government, the armed forces and the people, terrorism has been basically eliminated with tremendous sacrifices paid by society. Social security has been effectively maintained. China and Pakistan have cooperated in combating the 'three forces' over the years, and jointly safeguarded the construction of the CPEC.

China supports Pakistan in its efforts in carrying out the National Action Plan on anti-terrorism. China is ready to jointly enhance counter-terrorism capacity, and beef up international cooperation with Pakistan. Working hand in hand, China and Pakistan will play a more positive role in safeguarding the security of the two brotherly countries, as well as peace and stability in the region.

Representatives from Chinese and Pakistani film industries and production houses have called for greater cooperation and exchanges in the field of cinematography through joint production.

They also made suggestions for revival of Pakistani cinema through training workshops for filmmakers and technicians, expansion of market and diversification of audience by removing language barriers.

Academics, filmmakers and artists from the two countries were speaking at a conference on 'Chinese and Pakistani cinemas' at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) on Friday.

The conference was part of the four-day film festival organised by Chinese Cultural Centre in collaboration with the country's embassy, Chinese Film Corporation and Film Archives in connection with the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the people's republic.

Professor Zhou Xing, Director of Art Education, Research Centre, Beijing Normal University, Zhang Xin, Director of the Department of Exchange and Cooperation of Network of International Culture Link Entities, and Wang Xinglin, Chairman of the China Film Group Corporation explained Chinese cinema and the potential and opportunities for their Pakistani counterparts in China.

They said China's cinema had become No1 industry in the world after Hollywood producing about 900 films a year and earning billions of dollars at the box office.

They said compared to Pakistan making a movie in China was costlier because of its post-production cost and effects. A film costs $700m in China compared to $3,000 in Pakistan.

China has 60,000 screens and adds 30 per day. Over 1.6 billion people buying tickets to the cinemas.Chinese films grossed$500 millionoverseas.

PNCA Managing Director Jamal Shah, Aijaz Gul, noted filmmaker and distributor Satish Anand, Sadia Jabbar, CEO Sadia Jabbar Productions, filmmaker Raja Khan, renowned playwright, filmmaker and director Shahid Mehmood Nadeem, filmmaker Farooq Baig and Serendip Productions CEO Huma Baig also stressed the need for arranging workshops for Pakistani technicians and filmmakers to benefit from the Chinese expertise and technology.

Mr Shah said Pakistan had a great potential for film productions in terms of its beautiful locations, sites of ancient civilisations and heritages. The time-tested friendship does not reflect at cultural level and in films.

He urged the film aficionados and governments to explore means for creating space for the two countries' cinemas and encouraging join productions.

China has a great potential to expand its world market. But language barrier is a major hurdle in expanding Chinese cinema in Pakistan, said Sadia Jabbar.

Earlier, Prof Zhou in a digital presentation spoke about the 114 years history, evolution, traditional and aesthetic representation of Chinese cinematography.

He also spoke about the three important traditions of early Chinese films - family ethics comedy and martial art.

He also touched upon the first golden era of Chinese films (1930-1940) which highlighted the miseries of the people that surprised European filmmakers for using neorealism.

He also spoke about the film of the new China since the founding of the People's Republic in Oct 1949 depicting the exploitation and oppression of the working class, ethnic diversity and a true depiction of youth, love and emotional expression.

Professor Zhou spoke about the great changes the Chinese film industry witnessed after the economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping in 1978. Directors of the fourth generation created some excellent films ushering Chinese cinema into a new era.

Fifth generation directors

Prof Zhou spoke about the fifth generation directors who connected with the world featuring new form of expression, distinctive culture and diversity of life and won awards at Berlin Film Festival.

Chinese cinema with innovation and expansion of artistic creations and market has enhanced cooperation with filmmakers, opened its market to countries along the Belt and Road Initiative and doing co-productions with Hollywood, he said.

In the 21st century, Chinese cinema is bringing in more films including commercial film from other countries.

'We learn from others, carry forward the tradition of Chinese cinema, promote productions in demand and cultivate the young generation to work together with veteran directors,' the professor noted.


 
 

Will CPEC survive the IMF bailout?

The staff report released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week must have provided some measure of comfort to the champions of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as well as China that chose Pakistan to be the first key destination for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which aims to sustain its economic triumph and realise future ambitions.

If this is just a coincidence, it is intriguing. After a long lull, there is light blipping again on the CPEC drawing board. Last Friday, a 55-member Chinese delegation of business executives met Prime Minister Imran Khan and reportedly committed to ploughing $5 billion investment over the next five years. 'Probably the interaction with the Chinese delegations was already planned, but the fact that it did materialise as soon as details of the IMF deal were made public kindled new hope for the future,' commented a top leader of the government's economic team.

In its staff report following the approval of a three-year $6bn bailout programme, the IMF mentions the repayment of $14.68bn due for $21.8bn bilateral and commercial loans that Pakistan owes to China. This is almost 24pc of the country's total $85.8bn external debt and liabilities. The document states that the Chinese commercial debt will be fully retired by the end of the programme in 2022 while the bilateral debt ($15.5bn) will be almost half of what the country owes at this point to $7.9bn.

There is no official word from China on the apparent slow pace of CPEC projects. Its enthusiasm somewhat waned for want of clarity on the post-election economic direction

Sometime back, the United States explicitly expressed its dismay over the possibility that Pakistan could use the Fund's money to pay back Chinese loans. The US stance exasperated the anxieties surrounding the multibillion-dollar China's investment plan. The CPEC did stimulate growth and motivated economic drivers by removing infrastructure bottlenecks before the start of the current tumultuous phase in May last year.

There is no formal word on the issue from China. The enthusiasm of the dependable friendly nation did somewhat wane for want of clarity on the post-election economic direction. There were concerns about the intent of the new set of rulers on the pledges by the PML-N government regarding CPEC-related projects. The initial statements by members of Prime Minister Khan's economic dream team where they questioned the sealed deals must have added to the confusion. How far the visit helped to allay China's reservations is anyone's guess. But the optics are lacking if China is still as upbeat on the CPEC as before.

China prefers to speak with its silence most of the times. However, people in the know of things in Islamabad said that China did remind the current government, at some point, of the grave consequences of reneging on the earlier signed contractual obligations.

Approaching the relevant Chinese officers supervising the CPEC was a vain exercise as earlier efforts proved useless. It became apparent quickly that China feels neither keen nor obligated to share the details of its multiple deals. It sees no value in entertaining the prying journalists. Sometime back, a senior Chinese diplomat told this writer that whatever they wish to be known is put up on the CPEC website. He said their system does not allow free flow of information. 'We need clearance from Beijing before sharing our opinion. It takes time and does not serve the calls of fast-paced media based in democratic traditions.'

The relevant people in the federal government dismissed the perception that the ruling party knocks the wind out of the CPEC sail as being a figment of someone's imagination. All provinces, except Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, endorsed the counter-narrative - the movement on the CPEC agenda has indeed slowed down under the watch of the current government.

The focal person on the CPEC, Hasan Dawood Butt, sees the project progressing at the expected pace. He termed Pakistan 'the buckle of the Chinese belt initiative'. 'Prime Minister Khan is as much devoted and committed to the CPEC as anyone else. His successful meetings with the leadership in China hold testimony to his recognition of the project's value to the country and its people. We are moving ahead in the next phase of economic cooperation that focuses on development of the social sector and economic cooperation,' he said over the phone from Islamabad.

'We host Chinese experts and business delegations every other day. Recently, a delegation of the petroleum sector was in Islamabad to explore the avenues of joint ventures in special industrial zones,' he said. There are nine sites identified across Pakistan for special zones.

Mr Butt attributed the relative lack of visibility of the Chinese in Pakistan to the completion of several early-harvest programmes in the first phase. 'We are commencing the second phase of the CPEC where there are no big-ticket infrastructure projects that require Chinese technicians in big numbers. Instead, the focus now is on improving health, education and agriculture. There is discussion over agriculture co-branding etc. Once special zones become operational, perhaps the optics will improve,' he told Dawn.

The sense in the provincial capitals was different. Generally, officers were reluctant to come on record, but said that if the progress on the CPEC is not halted altogether, it is too slow to be seen as moving at all.

'Be it transport or industrial zones, I do not remember when it was last even mentioned in a high-level meeting. I don't have a shred of doubt in my mind that the lack of interest right now is mutually shared between both partners. It could be the preoccupation of China with sour trade relations with the United States or the obsession of Prime Minister Khan's team with the demands of the IMF. Whatever it is, it has pushed the CPEC down on the priority list on both sides,' a senior member of the hierarchy in Sindh said.

'At long last, the Punjab government has identified and started the process of acquiring land for the planned industrial zones. If all goes as planned, it will take another two years to fix the infrastructure and arrange for basic utilities before gates are opened to investors,' a senior officer from Punjab told Dawn.

Not everyone agrees. Dr Muhammad Amanullah, a senior officer from Punjab, defended the government. 'In the second phase under the new government, the focus of the CPEC has moved towards industrial development, agriculture and socio-economic development. The perception of a slowdown, therefore, is wrong as currently provincial governments are working towards identifying and proposing projects for special economic zones. The exercise needs research and spadework with eyes on realising the full potential of this opportunity,' he said.

KP Planning and Development Secretary Atif Rehman sounded optimistic. He said the work is in progress on the Rashakai Economic Zone. He was happy with the pace of progress.

According to insiders, not all of the 22 projects in the first phase of the CPEC worth about $29bn have been completed yet. Some eight projects in the power sector that are completed are said to be in financial troubles for the non-payment of dues.


 
 

Chinese whispers

IT'S relatively simple for the regime in Beijing to crack down on domestic dissent in mainland China. If matters seem to be getting out of hand, you can always send in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to liberate people from their illusions. It's a bit harder, however, when it comes to Hong Kong.

In the 22 years since that territory reverted from British colonial to Chinese rule, sporadic protests have, relatively speaking, been handled with kid gloves. The hand-over took place in 1997, when the 99-year lease that Britain had coerced out of China in the previous century ended; the transfer of power arrangement entailed 50 years of autonomy under a 'one country, two systems' formula.

That compact hasn't always worked to the satisfaction of Hongkongers, and there have been occasional protests throughout the present century, not least the umbrella demonstrations of 2014, whose demands included direct election of the territory's chief executive. They petered out, but unrest this time appears to have gathered a momentum that may be hard to subdue.

It was sparked early last month by a proposed piece of legislation intended to decree routine extradition to China for those accused of crimes. The local authorities sought to clarify that political offences would be excluded, but Hongkongers were never likely to fall for that ruse, given that there already have been instances of people such as publishers and booksellers being whisked away to the mainland for defying the party line, and not resurfacing until they have repented their 'sin'.

There has been no let-up in the popular agitation in Hong Kong.

It is widely presumed that Hong Kong's current chief executive, Carrie Lam, was following Beijing's orders in introducing this law. After an estimated one-third of Hong Kong's population took to the streets in opposition to the proposal, Lam relented and declared that the law was effectively dead, albeit without formally withdrawing it. But there has been no let-up in the effectively leaderless popular agitation, which has morphed into something much broader than a protest against the extradition bill.

An invasion of the territory's legislative chamber at the start of this month by a tiny proportion of protesters enabled the authorities to decry violence and extremism. It is not­a­ble, though, that police forces were uncha­r­a­c­teristically conspicuous by their absence on that occasion, as they were more recently when masked, white-clad members of criminal triads assaulted commuters at Yuen Long - many among them, but by no means all, making their way home from a protest march.

It has been conjectured, and may well be true, that the triads were in cahoots with the authorities. Even if that is an exaggeration, this instance of brutality feeds into the sense that criminals and the Chinese Communist Party are effectively on the same side.

Many of those out on the streets of Hong Kong weren't yet born, or were still in their nappies, when the territory was handed over to China in 1997. They have come of age during the transitory stage, and given their easy access to the rest of the world - a privilege denied to most of their mainland contemporaries - it is hardly surprising that they are keen to push back against encroachments on their homeland's semi-autonomy. They have little or no memory of British colonial rule, under which Hong Kong evolved into a formidable Asian commercial hub with limited political freedoms.

Those waving the Union Jack amid Hong Kong's current troubles, based on partly fake nostalgia, are not all that different from those who unquestioningly kowtow to the Chinese flag.

What will happen when the agreed 50-year period of 'one country, two systems' draws to a close in 2047? Hong Kong lacks the leeway Taiwan has in protecting its indepe­n­d­ence, despite bei­ng claimed by China as a recalcitrant province. A gre­at deal will dep­end on how Beijing's growing power is reflected in the decades ahead. But the signs are alarming in many respects.

What has been described as cultural genocide against the Uighur population of Xinjiang has been greeted with mild remonstrations from the West, and approval from many Muslim states, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, reinforcing China's impression that its pre-eminence as a buyer, seller and investor trumps even its most egregious acts of repression.

It's a different matter that many of its adversaries in the Belt and Road Initiative barely have a leg to stand on when it comes to neo-imperialism. There was a time not all that long ago when independence movements and newly independent nations picked either the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China as their potential saviours - and in many cases paid a heavy price for their choice. But at least they had a choice, unlike Hong Kong.

What may lie ahead in this instance is unclear. China may eventually swallow up Hong Kong, but for the moment the impression remains that, back in 1997, it bit off more than it can chew.

Enhance export capacity to cater to Chinese markets, say experts

Experts at a seminar on Monday called upon the government to enhance its export capacity to cater to the demand of Chinese markets at competitive pricing as the second phase of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Islamabad and Beijing is being finalised.

The seminar, 'Pakistan China Free Trade Agreement (FTA): where we are and where we are going?' was organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).

The speakers termed FTA a silver lining for Pakistan's economy.

Dr Wang Zhihua, Minister Counsellor Economics and Commercial Section at the Chinese embassy, said though trade volume between Pakistan and China had increased, trading imbalance remained the biggest challenge for the government and the business community of Pakistan.

'The main reason behind the trade imbalance between the two countries is of structural in nature where China has strong manufacturing base to export goods compared to import,' he said, adding the finalisation of the second phase of FTA on the sideline of the second Belt and Road Forum would help resolve these issues and further strengthen bilateral trade ties.

Dr Zhihua said as per the FTA phase two, China had agreed to eliminate duties on more than 300 products, especially in the agriculture sector where Pakistan had the potential to expand its export basket to China.

He said China also encouraged more business to business interaction activities to help Pakistani business community learn more about Chinese demand and needs.

Project Director and Focal Person for CPEC Hassan Daud Butt said the previous two FTAs could not yield the desired results and paved the way for another revised agreement for the benefit of both the countries.

'In the previous FTAs, there were no safeguard measures for industries, no synergy between relevant institutions and the balance of payment vision was not incorporated. Besides, no data exchange policy was agreed to counter under-invoicing issues.'

He argued that due to the lack of efficiency and relatively lower productivity of human resource, Pakistan was lagging behind in the race of competitiveness compared to its peer countries in the region and in the world.

He stressed the need for enhanced efficiency and urged the business community to initiate joint ventures with the Chinese businesses.

Mustafa Hyder Sayed, Executive Director Pakistan-China Institute, stressed the need for changing the mindset when it comes to trade with China.

'We always look for concessions, favours and grants and fail to develop our own market and industries' he said, adding the government and the business community of Pakistan should change the mindset.

Ambassador Ahmed Saleem hosted a large reception at Serena Hotel recently to celebrate the Maldives' Independence Day, marked on July 26. The country gained independence from the British in 1965.

Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry was invited to the event as the chief guest. During their speeches, the ambassador and the minister spoke about the close ties between the Maldives and Pakistan.

The Maldives is small country in the Indian Ocean, situated some 1,000 kilometres south of the Asian continent, with a population of less than half a million people. Last year, the country received more than a million tourists.

'Our economy and welfare rely heavily on tourism. Some European countries, which are very popular tourist destinations, have begun restricting their high numbers of tourists, such Venice in Italy and Norway, where the cruise ships disturb daily life more than people like in the picturesque small town harbours and fjords.

'In the Maldives, we have not reached that level and we are welcoming even higher numbers of tourists. We expand our infrastructure and develop new sites,' the ambassador said in a conversation.

Tourism accounts for about a third of the GDP and almost two-thirds of the foreign exchange earnings in the Maldives. The country's GDP per capita is significantly higher than that of other countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, which the Maldives co-founded in 1985.

The ambassador said that the Maldives has not been a member of the Commonwealth for some years, but will rejoin the organisation soon. In the future, it is likely that the country will be severely affected by sea level rise and flooding due to global warming.

'We set aside funds, mainly from tourism, to meet the challenges,' Ambassador Saleem said.

India following in Israel's footsteps to change demography in held Kashmir: Mushahid

'The annexation of India-Occupied Kashmir by Modi is comparable to Nehru's annexation of Hyderabad, Junagadh and Goa. Then, too, there was the partition of Kashmir, done on religious lines as Ladakh was said to have a Buddhist majority and Jammu and Kashmir a Muslim majority. India is basically trying to implement the Israeli occupation model in Palestine for changing demography and transforming the majority into a minority,' said Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee.

He was giving a talk on 'The changing global scenario: impact on Pakistan and the region' organised by the English Speaking Union of Pakistan (ESUP) at a local hotel here on Wednesday.

'Modi's action [in] India-Occupied Kashmir is the most significant development in the South Asian subcontinent since 1971, when the geography of the region changed. It has helped internationalise the Kashmir dispute for the first time since the 1998 nuclear tests, when the UN Security Council passed the last unanimous resolution, No. 1172, on June 6, 1998, mentioning Kashmir by name while urging both India and Pakistan to resume dialogue on all outstanding issues and encouraging them to find mutually acceptable solutions that address the root causes of those tensions, including Kashmir,' he added.

'China and Russia are seen as a greater threat by the US than Al Qaeda or ISIS'

'We should seize this opportunity to move forward without having to alienate any of our neighbours as it is also important to learn from our past mistakes,' he said.

Looking back at history, he spoke about the vision of the founding fathers of Pakistan. Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had given an interview to Life magazine back in October of 1947, which was published in January of 1948 when the nascent Pakistan was at war with India, its money was also held up as it faced an exodus of population from India. At the time when Mr Jinnah was asked about Pakistan's role, he had very confidently replied that the future of geopolitics would rotate around Pakistan.

He saw Pakistan as the eye of the storm. Then in May/June of 1950, when Quaid-i-Millat Liaquat Ali Khan visited the US there were a series of pieces based on his visit by Walter Lippmann and Pakistan had been referred to by him as the 'Heart of Asia'.

Then, reminding of the developments of 40 years ago, he spoke about the four major developments impinging on Pakistan's role in the region affecting foreign policy and its relations with other countries, especially its neighbours. There was the Iranian Revolution, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, China's deciding to change its course for the sake of its economy and there was the US decision to establish a permanent presence in the Gulf.

'The impact of these things can be felt to this day. The 21st Century is Asia's century as the influence and clout of Western countries diminishes and China's transformation from a regional to a global power is evident. We also have the makings of a cold war where China and Russia are seen as a greater threat by the US than Al Qaeda or ISIS. And here is Pakistan located right in the middle of all the action,' the senator said.

'With Pakistan, China, Russia and Afghanistan working together for the Belt and Road Initiative [BRI], there is also a glimmer of hope for the peace process in Afghanistan to be successful. The BRI and its flagship project the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor [CPEC] promoting regional connectivity, peace in Afghanistan is intertwined with the peace and security of Pakistan,' he said, reminding of Allama Iqbal's words from 1932 when he said that if there was a conflict in Afghanistan, it meant a conflict in Asia and if there was peace in Afghanistan, it meant peace in Asia.

He also said that CPEC and BRI would help interconnectivity between some 100 countries, including countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe, and the many projects associated with them had already provided 17,000 jobs to Pakistanis while 28,000 Pakistani students were also studying in China. 'Pakistan's strategic place in all this has even gotten the US president into realising that his electoral success also depends on peace in Afghanistan as instability in this region affects economic growth. Trump, who used to see Pakistan as part of the problem, now sees us as part of the solution,' he said.

'Pakistan's being seen as an unstable, volatile and terror-infested place has also changed due to CPEC. We play a big role in making South Asia great through energy projects, roads and routes connecting so many countries, including Iran. China and Pakistan are very much focused on international cooperation for greater economic cooperation in the region. And the government, armed forces, political parties here have all risen to the occasion,' he said.

'In this scenario, the kind of actions by India and their mindset is dangerous. There is a strong anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan content there. The consequence of Modi's policies will lead to deterioration in the relationship between Pakistan and India. It is a challenge for Pakistan as to how it can highlight the plight of Kashmiris and alleviate their suffering. It has to be done like we handled our nuclear programme despite so many pressures,' he said.

'There also has to be a strategy for India, which is a diverse society, something which we need to keep in mind. There needs to be an outreach to their society because Modi's thinking is not the thinking of entire India,' he concluded.


 
 

Pakistan should aspire to working relationship with US, says former ambassador

Pakistan should not seek a strategic relationship with the United States and should instead aspire to a working relationship that is cordial and dynamic and does not curtail sovereignty and national interest, former ambassador Riaz Khokhar said on Monday.

Giving a guest lecture on 'Improving Pakistan-US Relations: Ways and Means', organised by the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI), Mr Khokhar explored Pakistan's relationship with the US in light of the former's ties with China and the latter's with India.

Mr Khokhar was posted as Pakistan's envoy to Dhaka, New Delhi, Washington D.C. and Beijing before becoming foreign secretary in 2002.

He said on Wednesday that India is an important actor influencing the dynamic between Pakistan and the US.

'The US expects India to be a partner in the containment of China and in this regard, Pakistan's overall endorsement of the Belt and Road Initiative may also be problematic for Washington, so the Western countries have a soft corner for Delhi,' he said.

He added: 'That is why India is painted as a responsible nuclear power.'

Discussing rising tensions in India-held Kashmir, Mr Khokhar remarked that mild US statements on Indian atrocities were indicative of where their sympathies lie.

'War is neither an option for India nor for Pakistan, both have nuclear capabilities. Pakistan would like to live in peace and harmony with India. We should engage with India but not beg for a dialogue,' he said, adding: 'A dialogue has to be in the interest of both countries. As far as Kashmir is concerned, India has never agreed to third-party mediation, and I doubt they ever will.'

On Prime Minister Imran Khan's meeting with US President Donald Trump and the situation in India-held Kashmir, Mr Khokhar said Pakistan and the US have been allies and have shed blood together.

He said neither side can easily brush this relationship aside, in spite of Mr Trump's choice of hard words at times and vacillating approach towards Pakistan.

'My take is that we should not be emotional about our relationship with the US. Pakistan needs to have a working relationship.' he said.

'Every US security document over the past few years identifies China as a major threat for the US, followed by Russia, North Korea and Iran. Pakistan has historic relations with China that go as far back as the 1950s, and neither side should allow anyone to undermine this relation,' he added.

He said the US' main interest remains Afghanistan, and Pakistan believes that 'it has to be an Afghan solution'.

IPRI President retired ambassador Khan Hasham bin Saddique provided a brief historical overview of Pak-US relations and said: 'Unfortunately, our relationship with the US has historically suffered due to a lack of trust on both sides.'

He added that current relations are transactional.


 
 

Dignity in foreign relations

THE desire for dignity, self-esteem and appreciation motivates humans and nations alike, significantly impacting their behaviours. This desire partially originates from a fear of humiliation. Dignity is capital that a nation earns through a cultured polity, strong economy, and its geographical and strategic strengths. Eventually, it determines the friends and foes of a nation.

Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi's statement on the silence of the Muslim 'ummah' over India's oppression of Kashmir reflects that Pakistan lacks some essential component to develop equal and robust bilateral relations with other nations. Fed with the narratives of the ummah and Muslim brotherhood since the country was founded, many in Pakistan wonder why the ummah only showed solidarity with their country when it was internally and strategically strong. It also vindicates the view that religion and ideologies do not provide any foundation for strong relations among nations. In reality, these remain secondary, and largely come into play when aligned with national interests of economic and strategic significance.

When so-called friends do not stand with Pakistan in its hour of need, it hurts, and many Pakistanis feel humiliated. In this age of a growing identity politics, populism is not only confined to domestic political contexts, but also factors in an identification of friends and foes in international politics. Francis Fukuyama, in his recent book Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, contextualises contemporary identity politics by explaining three parts of the human soul. The first is about primitive desires, such as thirst or hunger. 'The second is more rational - like the voice that tells us to avoid rotten meat even when we're hungry. But independent of these is a third part, thymos, which yearns for dignity and recognition from other people.' He argues that identity politics is rooted in thymos because it revolves around a particular group's fight for dignity and recognition.

Does Pakistan need to do some soul-searching to re-evaluate its friends and foes? Perhaps it is high time for us to rid ourselves of the illusion of a united Muslim world. One international wire service report provided a rationale behind Gulf countries' muted response over India-held Kashmir. These countries have more than $100 billion in annual trade with India, making it a prized economic partner. In contrast, Pakistan has lost its economic balance with its Arab allies; rather, it looks to them for bailouts whenever its economy is in a crisis. A dignified relationship with Gulf countries will remain a dream unless Pakistan's economy and self-esteem recover.

Does Pakistan need to do some soul-searching to re-evaluate its friends and foes?

Pakistan's relationship with the Arabs and Iran has never been easy. To influence Pakistani state and society, both have been managing their sectarian proxies in the country, which contributes towards making the militant landscape even more volatile. Pakistan's reliance on the Arab world started when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto changed its foreign policy alignment from Cento-centric to Arab-focused. The Shah of Iran had then warned Bhutto that these relationships would not prove strategically worthy. The Shah also boycotted the International Islamic Summit held in Lahore in 1974. Still, he helped Pakistan in the aftermath of 1971, which Bhutto used as an opportunity for realignment with the Arab world.

Alex Vatanka, an expert on Iranian affairs, provides fabulous accounts on this in his book Iran and Pakistan: Security, Diplomacy and American Influence, and describes how the Lahore summit had weakened Pakistan-Iran relations, despite the fact that the Shah dispatched his foreign minister to Lahore on Bhutto's insistence. The realignment paid off for Pakistan. Before 1974, Islamabad did not receive direct financial aid from any Arab country. Bhutto changed that, and Arab oil money began to flow.

However, after the regime change in Iran and military coup in Pakistan, things quickly changed. The West's reliance on its Arab friends increased to sustain peace in the Middle East and to partner in Afghanistan to defeat the Soviet Union. Pakistan changed its policy direction as well for its own geopolitical reasons. While contexts have changed now, Pakistan's growing reliance on Arabs for deferred oil payments and bailouts hurts its equity in relations with them.

The support for Kashmiris and Pakistan has come from three corners. First, from the international media and human rights organisations, which are highlighting the issue and building diplomatic pressure on India. Second, from China, which has helped to make the United Nations Security Council take notice of the issue. And third, from the US that is constantly offering mediation, which is irritating India. Turkey and Malaysia's responses were also adequate.

Read: China to 'uphold justice for Pakistan' on Kashmir issue

The rationale and politics behind these responses are not difficult to understand. The US needs Pakistan in Afghanistan, and China is one of the parties to the Kashmir dispute. China may also have concerns in the context of CPEC and the Belt and Road Initiative, as the Kashmir issue has disturbed the regional political landscape, which is not a good sign for economic connectivity.

Historically, both the US and China have remained a significant pillar of Pakistan's external relations, and Pakistan has managed ties with both at functional levels, and extracted advantages. Perhaps Pakistan needs the same balance between the two, as China's investment is crucial for Pakistan apart from sharing with it strategic and political interests. The relationship with the US is crucial, not only for economy and strategic interests but also for its global image. Pakistan's image determines the level of dignity and respect it holds among nations.

It may be difficult for Pakistan to develop a new geostrategic partnership with Iran in a contemporary context. But geo-economic connectivity with Iran in partnership with China can help Pakistan balance its ties between Gulf countries and Iran, and will help improve its image within regional Muslim countries.

However, major fundamentals of earning dignity in the global community are domestic, and these entail continued cooperation with the global community in its efforts to counter terrorism and extremism, and achieve peace in Afghanistan. The militants hurt the thymos of Pakistan the most, and they must not be allowed to come back.


 
 

Six Chinese men indicted in ATM-skimming fraud cases

A sessions court has indicted six Chinese nationals in cases pertaining to ATM-skimming fraud.

The six men - Zhang Qiaocheng, Zhong Showen, Liu Liming, Xiao Jianjun, Zhu Yu Ping and Zeng Chun You - have been booked and arrested for allegedly committing electronic crimes, fraud and forgery between 2016 and 2018.

District and Sessions Judge (south) Amjad Ali Bohio read out the charges against the accused. However, they pleaded not guilty and opted to contest the case.

The court summoned all prosecution witnesses to record their testimonies on the next date.

Earlier on July 10, 2018, then district and sessions judge Imdad Hussain had framed charges on all accused. However, when the incumbent judge took up the matter on July 31, he noted that from the perusal of the record and proceedings of the case it transpired that the charges framed by his predecessor did not mention the date and time of the offences and the case was proceeded on defective charges, which was required to be amended.

He observed that the error of not mentioning the date of the incident would in fact mislead the accused to defend their case and, therefore, framed the amended/altered charge against the detained foreigners after hearing arguments from both sides on this point.

In his arguments, defence counsel Ahmed Khoso submitted that witnesses had already deposed the date of the incident during their evidence and thus there was no need to alter or amend the charge. The charge could not be altered or amended after all the witnesses were examined by the court and the prosecution had rested its side, he added.

All the accused have denied charges and opted to contest the case

FIA's Additional Director (legal) and special prosecutor Zakir Hussain Khan argued that the charge framed earlier without mentioning the date and time of the offence was defective and it would prejudice the accused in their defence as well as the prosecution in proving its case.

According to the amended charge, accused Zhang Qiaocheng and Zhong Shaowen were allegedly spotted in suspicious conditions around an ATM machine installed at an HBL branch on Abdullah Haroon Road for two days.

On Jan 10, 2018 FIA officials captured them at 8:15pm while trying to insert a skimming device at the said ATM machine by committing unauthorised access to the critical infrastructure information system with an intention to cause damage to the public property, it added.

Therefore, they committed an offence punishable under Section 13 (electronic forgery) of the Prevention of Electronic Crime Act (PECA), 2016 read with Section 420 (cheating or dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Pakistan Penal Code, said the amended charge.

It added that on a lead provided by the held accused the FIA officials also recovered 102 blank debit/credit cards, a union pay card, a 16 gigabytes memory card from their room in a guesthouse in Khayaban-i-Tanzeem, Defence Housing Authority. Investigators also recovered a magnetic strip reader (MSR) writer, other equipment and passports, it added.

According to the amended charge, both the accused used the equipment to counterfeit the ATM cards/credit cards with dishonest intentions for unauthorised access to the information system or data to unauthorised copying or transmitting the data, thus committed an offence punishable under Sections 3 (unauthorised access to information system or data), 4 (unauthorised copying or transmission of data) of the PECA, 2016.

The accused also committed the offences of cyber terrorism and cheating to deceive any person punishable under Sections 5 (interference with information system or data), 6 (unauthorised access to critical infrastructure information system or data), 7 (unauthorised copying or transmission of critical infrastructure data), 10(a) (cyber terrorism) and 14 (unauthorised use of identity information) of the PECA, 2016, it added.

According to the prosecution, the management of the HBL filed a complaint stating that over Rs10 million had been stolen from 559 of its customers' accounts through bogus ATMs, credit and debit cards. The transactions had been traced to Indonesia, China and other countries, it added.

It alleged that the accused tried to escape but the area people caught them, adding that an ATM-skimming device was allegedly recovered from their possession. Both the suspects had arrived in Pakistan on Jan 2, 2018 on business visas.

In an identical case, in June 2016, two Chinese nationals were arrested for allegedly stealing data from a private bank with skimming devices at one of its ATM facilities.

The bank had reported to the FIA about suspicious activity of two foreigners at their Plaza Square branch. The FIA claimed to have recovered some electronic equipment, two skimming devices, each having a 16GB memory card, Chinese passports and identity cards of the suspects and different cards of Chinese banks.

Later, the accused moved applications in court stating that the investigating officer of the FIA's cybercrime cell had failed to further proceed with the matter. Subsequently, the matter was still pending trial since no significant progress was made by the prosecution, they added in their pleas.

It was stated that the maximum punishment for the offences was three-year imprisonment, but they already spent around one-and-a-half year in jail since their arrest.

They further stated that they opted to plead guilty and asked to the court to order their release by considering the period of their sentences as already undergone from the date of their detention in prison. However, they withdrew the applications later.

Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Sunday Pakistan was committed to timely completion of projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and hoped that more Chinese companies would make investments in the country.

During his meeting with visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the prime minister highlighted the importance of the proposed CPEC authority for speedy execution of the projects.

Mr Khan also briefed the Chinese FM on the situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK) and both agreed on more high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China to further promote bilateral ties and shared goals.

During his two-day official visit, the Chinese FM also held meetings with President Dr Arif Alvi, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Army Chief Gen Qamar Bajwa. During the meetings bilateral, regional and international issues were discussed and both sides agreed to jointly promote regional peace, stability and prosperity.

He highlighted that CPEC was a project of great national significance that contributed immensely to revitalisation of Pakistan's economy.

Visiting foreign minister reaffirms support on Kashmir issue

Mr Khan underscored that friendship with China was cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign policy. He briefed the Chinese side on the evolving situation in IoK following India's Aug 5 unilateral and illegal action to strip the region of autonomy.

He stressed that the ongoing curfew for 35 days and continued lockdown and communications blockade coupled with massive human rights violations had created a dire humanitarian situation in IoK which needed to be urgently addressed.

Prime Minister Khan said that the curfew and other restrictions needed to be immediately lifted.

To deepen strategic cooperation, Pakistan and China should continue their close coordination and consultation to ensure that peace and stability in the region was maintained, he said.

Wang Yi said that Pakistan-China relationship was based on mutual respect, trust and strong bonds of friendship. He appreciated Pakistan's efforts to achieve goals of national development under Prime Minister Khan's leadership, and extended China's utmost support in this regard.

He noted that with the policies of the government, Pakistan's economic and financial condition was improving.

Wang Yi emphasised that the CPEC, which was being jointly implemented by Pakistan and China, was a demonstration project of high quality Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects.

The Chinese foreign minister conveyed best wishes of President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang to Mr Khan and said China-Pakistan relationship was rock-solid and unbreakable.

Wang Yi reaffirmed China's support and reiterated opposition to any Indian unilateral action (regarding held Kashmir) as well as the measures by Delhi that could further complicate the situation.

Both leaders agreed that more high-level exchanges should continue to take place between Pakistan and China to further promote bilateral ties and shared goals of economic development, peace, and security across the region.

Joint statement

Earlier, the Foreign Office issued a joint statement at the conclusion of the two-day official visit of the Chinese foreign minister.

According to the statement, Wang Yi also called on President Dr Arif Alvi and Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and met Chief of the Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

During the meetings, both sides had an in-depth exchange of views on bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual interest.

Both sides reiterated that the time-tested all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between China and Pakistan remained unaffected by any adverse regional and international development and continued to move from strength to strength.

Both sides reaffirmed that China-Pakistan relationship was a priority in their foreign policies, and committed to build a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era.

Both sides agreed to maintain frequent mutual visits and meetings at the leadership level and continue to hold bilateral meetings between their leaders on multilateral occasions.

They noted that China and Pakistan had enjoyed mutual understanding and support on issues concerning each other's core interests. They reiterated the resolve to implement consensus reached by the leadership of both countries to enhance strategic mutual trust and improve all-round cooperation to jointly promote regional peace, stability and prosperity.

The Chinese side reaffirmed its support for Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and national dignity, in choosing its development path in light of its national conditions, in working for a better external security environment, and in playing a more constructive role in regional and international issues.

Both sides believed that the CPEC, as a pioneering project of the BRI, had entered a new phase of high-quality development. They agreed to continue to firmly push forward the construction of CPEC, complete its ongoing projects in a timely manner, and realise its full potential by focusing on socio-economic development, job creation and better livelihood and accelerating cooperation in industrial parks and agriculture.

Both sides expressed satisfaction over the close cooperation between the two countries at multilateral fora and resolved to deepen strategic coordination and consultation. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and support for multilateralism, free trade and win-win cooperation. Both sides agreed to strengthen coordination and cooperation on regional and international affairs.

Both sides underlined that a peaceful, stable, cooperative and prosperous South Asia was in common interest of all parties and agreed that parties needed to settle disputes and issues in the region through dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and equality.

Both sides also exchanged views on the situation in India-held Kashmir.

The Pakistani side briefed the Chinese side on the situation, including its concerns, position and urgent humanitarian issues.

The Chinese side responded that it was paying close attention to the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir and reiterated that the Kashmir issue was a dispute left from history, and should be properly and peacefully resolved based on the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. China opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation.

Both sides agreed to strengthen cooperation on the Afghan issue and support Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation process. Both sides welcomed the positive progress achieved in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and the US, and called on all Afghan political stakeholders, including the Taliban, to start intra-Afghan negotiations to form a future political structure acceptable to all parties so that peace and stability might be achieved in Afghanistan at an early date.

India is irked by the reference to occupied Kashmir in a joint statement issued by Pakistan and China following Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Pakistan on September 7-8, The Hindu newspaper reported.

According to The Hindu, Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar on Tuesday rejected the Pak-China joint statement and called on Pakistan and China to stop China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) related activities in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

Kumar was quoted as saying: "We reject the reference to Jammu and Kashmir in the joint statement issued by China and Pakistan after the recent visit of Chinese Foreign Minister. J and K is an integral part of India."

Additionally, he said that India has consistently expressed concerns to both Pakistan and China about CPEC projects in AJK, which he claimed was "territory of India that has been illegally occupied by Pakistan since 1947".

He added that India was "resolutely opposed" to actions by any other countries to change the status quo of AJK.

"We call on the parties concerned to cease such actions," Kumar said.

IT was obvious to those of us who either have stakes in government policy or have been following the making and implementation of policy for many years now, but increasingly it is also becoming obvious to others. Sooner or later, this country will need somebody at the helm who knows how to run things.

For a year, we have lived on fiery rhetoric and outlandish delusions disguised as policy. For a year, the reigning assumption at the top was that all Pakistan needs is for one man to come to power, and like the proverbial fish that supposedly rots from the head down, the country's rot will end and things will fix themselves automatically. For a year, the belief was that we just need to put the bad guys away, appeal to the better angels in people's nature, and the deficits would be plugged and the wheels of governance begin to turn once again.

This was the thinking behind the appeal for the dam fund, behind the Pakistan Banao certificates, behind the prime minister's hotline and app-based complaint registration system, behind that bizarre midnight announcement on the night the budget was presented, promising vengeance and fire and brimstone for his opponents. It's been a methylated year for sure, with emotions stirred and people's brains whipped to a froth.

But now, all that is changing. Now somebody seems to be getting the hint upstairs that things cannot go on like this. The country won't run itself. And in truth a fish does not rot from the head down. It actually rots from the inside out. So much for that tired metaphor.

For a year, we have lived on fiery rhetoric and outlandish delusions disguised as policy.

What has changed? Two things: the IMF programme implementation began, and a steady stream of visitors seems to be passing through Islamabad (and in one case Peshawar) from China urging the government to get to work on the second phase of CPEC that has been stalled up till now.

The Chinese visitors are not exactly headline material yet. But something important is happening, given the regularity with which the government is being prodded by various Chinese delegations, in some cases headed by senior officials, and the equally regular stream of announcements coming from various quarters of the government that they remain committed to CPEC, that the projects will now be fast tracked. In one case, none other than Khusro Bakhtiar, the minister for planning and inheritor of the mantle previously worn by Ahsan Iqbal, announced that the government was prepared to create an overarching CPEC authority to oversee the implementation of the second phase from end to end.

The latest of such announcements was on Sunday during the Islamabad visit of Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister. Pakistan remains committed to CPEC, Prime Minister Imran Khan said, following his meeting. He reiterated the idea of creating a CPEC authority, mentioned the importance of the 'speedy implementation' of CPEC projects, and talked of the benefits Pakistan would get once more Chinese companies began to invest in the country.

This was not the first such public announcement. Since April, when Khan paid his visit to Beijing for the annual Belt and Road conference, there have been a number of such announcements. For example, during the conference, both governments signed a concessional agreement to develop the Rashakai Special Economic Zone, one of the nine planned zones under the second phase of CPEC. Then the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Economic Zones Development and Management Company announced that the prime minister would soon perform the groundbreaking ceremony for the zone.

There is no further mention of any groundbreaking ceremony, and that announcement was back in the first week of May. The CPEC website simply says land acquisition is complete.

Rashakai is not the only sticking point. No breakthrough has been made in financing for the ML-1 railroad upgradation project either. In fact, hardly any of the commitments and understandings contained in the overall CPEC portfolio have advanced, and the Chinese are taking notice of this.

The question many people are asking is whether this delay is on purpose because the government is not eager about the idea of CPEC, or whether it is because of incompetence, since the people brought in by this dispensation, in both provincial as well as federal governments, are not exactly known for their ability to get things done, at least not for the public. A quick look at the Peshawar BRT project should confirm this.

So are they being clever or are they just incompetent? If they're being clever, then perhaps it's a little too clever to give commitments and timelines on specific actions at the prime minister's level, then fail to move on them. And if incompetence is the answer, like it is in so many other areas as the whole GIDC fiasco so spectacularly displayed, then it obviously cannot continue much longer.

It is the same story with the IMF programme. The whole programme is built around one massive revenue target and a very steep target for accumulating foreign exchange reserves. All else is secondary. The problem with this implementation is that it puts the PTI government directly at odds with people's pocket book issues. The public's ire against rising prices, diminishing job opportunities and incomes invariably falls upon those in power. People do not make careful distinctions to say 'well, the pressures built up under the previous government'. They simply tell each other 'when the other people were in power, things were better'. Full stop.

The challenge for those in power is to manage the politics that such a perception creates. The more serious challenge for those currently in power is that managing such politics takes considerable skill. So the time has come to demonstrate skill in running things, and that part has the great Khan all flustered, hence the red letters and the daily meetings on the economy. It'll take more than bluster and bombast to get through this one though.

Hailing round-the-clock functioning of the Torkham border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan for trade, Chinese ambassador to Islamabad Yao Jing said Beijing was ready to build cold storage and other facilities in the border town to promote trade and commerce in the region.

'The functioning of the Torkham border crossing is very meaningful for expansion of trade in future,' the envoy told reporters on the sidelines of the two-day international conference on 'Belt and Road Initiative, Pakistan and China Economic Corridor and Trans-Regional Integration' at the Area Study Centre of the University of Peshawar here on Wednesday.

Ambassadors from five Central Asian States, including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, senior diplomats of the Russian Federation and Iran, senior officials of the Foreign Office, faculty members, and experts are attending the high-level event.

Though Afghanistan serves as a gateway between Central Asia and South Asia and China, the war-ravaged country's ambassador and top officers of its mission in Islamabad were absent. The Saudi ambassador, too, did not show up despite being formally invited.

Envoy says 24-hour opening of Pak-Afghan border crossing to promote trade

The Chinese Embassy, Islamabad, UoP Area Study Centre, and CPEC Centre of Excellence, Islamabad, are jointly organising the conference with the collaboration of the Centre for Global and Strategic Studies, Islamabad.

Director of the UoP Area Study Centre Professor Shabir Ahmad Khan inaugurated the conference.

The Chinese envoy termed the 24-hour functioning of the Torkham border crossing a very positive step and said China was ready to build customs, cold storage facilities and hospital there.

He said during a conference held in Islamabad last week, China, Pakistan and Afghanistan had decided to work together for the construction of Kabul-Peshawar Highway and its further expansion to the Central Asian States.

The Torkham border crossing, around 55 kilometers west of Peshawar, was opened round-the-clock on a trial basis last Monday to enhance trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Prime Minister Imran Khan and Afghan President Dr Ashraf Ghani are expected to attend the formal crossing opening ceremony on Sept 14, officials said.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has planned to announce several incentives for traders and provision of other facilities.

When asked about the suspension of talks between the US and Afghan Taliban, the Chinese ambassador said Washington's announcement in that respect had surprised him.

He said Americans and Afghan Taliban had been negotiating for a long time and everyone had some hopes because Afghanistan had a war-like situation for too long.

'Generally, we hope that this kind of peace efforts should continue and should be carried forward,' he said.

When asked about China' stand on the situation in India-occupied Kashmir, the envoy said that Beijing's position on Kashmir was very clear.

'We are against unilateral change to the status quo (by the revoking of Article 370 of the Constitution) by Indians. We think that the international law, UN charter, resolutions and bilateral agreements should be honoured,' he said.

The envoy said China was concerned about 'humanitarian situation' in the occupied Kashmir. 'By now, a lot of international communities have raised their concern and we hope that the dispute should be settled through dialogue between the two countries,' he said.

Earlier, Mr Jing told the conference that China wanted connectivity of the region through mutually-agreed projects and non-confrontational strategies.

He said China was looking to complete Peshawar-Karachi Motorway section sooner, while the Peshawar-Kabul Motorway section was the next shot.

In his opening remarks Area Study Centre director Prof Shabir Ahmad Khan asked key stakeholders to fully participate in this millennium project of 'open integration' of regional countries without restrictions and imposed goals.

He said countries in today's world prospered due to openness, mutual learning andexperience.

Prof Shabir said his centre would serve as a pivotal point to garner scholastic and intellectual input for the projects of 21st century.

Diplomats from the Central Asian States told participants that Karachi and Gwadar provided the shortest route to landlocked countries.

They called for regional connectivity to provide more opportunities for development and regional cooperation.

Centre of Global Strategic Studies President retired Major-General Syed Khalid Jafferipointed out that regional integration would take a longer time if the Afghan security situation didn't develop stable and secure environment for connectivity routes.

He, however, warned that the routes from Xinjiang could bypass it in the long run.

CPEC Centre of Excellence director Liaqat Ali Shah said industrial and trade development would happen after major energy and infrastructure initiatives were completed under the CPEC project.

He said he was optimistic that the CPEC and BRI projects would boost regional economies as regional business would have a lion's share in the trade.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director General (China) Mudassir Tipu said Peshawar, the sister city of Urumqi, had an important role to play in the BRI and connectivity of Peshawar between western China and Central Asian States.


 
 

Political stability, good governance key to CPEC success: experts

Human resource development, political stability and good governance can be the main components to make the multibillion dollars China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project sustainable and result-oriented.

This was the crux of the speeches delivered during the two-day international conference, which ended here on Thursday.

The University of Peshawar's Area Study Centre and Chinese Embassy had jointly organised the event on 'Belt and Road Initiative, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and Trans-Regional Integration', where ambassadors and diplomats from China, Russia, Central Asian Republics, Iran and Afghanistan were in attendance.

Seven scholars from abroad, including Russian Federation, and academicians and experts representing think tanks read out their papers in the two-day conference.

International moot on BRI, corridor initiatives ends

The experts highlighted challenges and prospects of the BRI and CPEC, brainchild of Chinese President Xi Jinping that would economically integrate more than 60 countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.

Former chief secretary Shakeel Durrani told participants that the BRI-CPEC was our version of the Martial Plan, which was introduced in Europe after the World War-II.

He said the Martial Plan had transformed Europe after the war.

Mr Durrani proposed that the railway network occupy central place in the integration of the region. He supported the proposed construction of the Kabul-Peshawar Motorway.

The former chief secretary said the projects like CPEC could either rid the country of poverty or face failure.

He said on one hand, the projects like Gadoon Amazai Industrial Estate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa failed to produce the desired results but on the other, the projects like Tarbela and Mangla dams continued to contribute to the national economy.

Mr Durrani said the CPEC had to be a self-sustained project, while the Pakistani government had to focus on human resource development, political stability and good governance.

He said one of the major reasons for the failure of Gadoon Amazai initiative was bad governance.

The former chief secretary also called for control of population growth. Afghan academician Abdul Baqi said his country would play a central role in regional connectivity due to its geographical location.

He said Afghanistan was in the centre of South Asia and Central Asia, so two major energy projects would pass through its territory.

Mr Baqi said the prevailing security situation in Afghanistan were major hurdles to the laying of railway line, which could link South Asia with Central Asia.

Expressing concern over the existing security situation in Afghanistan, he said who was behind the so-called Islamic State or Daesh militant outfits was a mystery.

He said regional countries could play a role in intra-Afghan dialogue to end decades long conflict.

In a paper, Kazakhstani researcher Dr Seyit Ali Avcu insisted that anti-Chinese sentiment and fear of over-indebting to China while misusing its own finances and re-education camps in Xinjiang that caused uproar could pose threat to the BRI.

He said since the economic and political relations between Russian and China had never been so good, not all Central Asian countries were part of Eurasian Economic Union.

The researcher said the Chinese influence on Central Asia was purely economic rather than political and that Eurasian Economic Union and BRI initiative would coexist and prosper side by side.

He added that the New Silk Road initiative of the US would have negative effect since the US was withdrawing from the region and was not committing enough funds to make the initiative sustainable.


 
 

 China  strikes back

THE Petroleum Economist of Sept 3 reported that China has agreed to invest up to $290 billion in the development of Iran's oil, gas and petroleum sectors, and another $120bn in its transport and manufacturing infrastructure. This is a calculated kick aimed at America's strategic objectives.

According to the report, China will have the first right of refusal on all projects in Iran and a 12 per cent guaranteed discount on energy imports from there. China will provide the 'technology, systems, process ingredients and personnel required to complete such projects' including 'up to 5,000 Chinese security personnel on the ground to protect Chinese projects….'

China's agreement to so massively finance Iran's development is an extension of its Belt and Road Initiative. It is also an 'in your face' response to America's aggressive trade, technology and military moves against China over the last year. It will prick the balloon of the US strategy of 'maximum pressure' against Iran designed to bring the latter to its knees economically and oblige it to accept additional constraints on its nuclear and missile programs (beyond the JCPOA) and curb its politico-military ambitions in the Middle East. In entering this agreement, China has announced that it is not intimidated by the 'secondary sanctions' which the US has threatened to impose on companies and countries which continue economic relations with Iran in defiance of America's unilateral sanctions against Iran.

China can import virtually all of Iran's oil and gas production. This could increase Iran's oil exports manifold from 200,000 barrels per day at present to its full capacity over 4-5 million bpd. China's energy giants - CNPC, CNOC, Sinopec - can rapidly expand Iran's oil and gas production from existing and new fields. Iran will not need other markets, such as India which has halted oil imports from Iran in compliance with US sanctions.

China's agreement to massively finance Iran's development is an extension of its Belt and Road Initiative.

A considerable part of Iran's gas could be exported via the existing Turkmenistan-China gas pipeline and new oil pipelines can be constructed on the same route. This will significantly diminish the threat of a US/Western maritime energy blockade against China or Iran. Further, China's reliance on US-friendly energy suppliers in the Gulf (Saudi Arabia, UAE) and East Asia (Indonesia, Brunei) will be dramatically reduced since it could meet all or most of its requirements from Iran and Russia.

The transport infrastructure which China plans to build in Iran, including high-speed rail on several routes, will provide Beijing with additional avenues for its trade - overland trade through Iran and Turkey to and from Europe and maritime trade through Iranian ports (including, ironically, the hitherto Indian-sponsored port of Chahbahar) to the Middle East, Africa and beyond.

Iran's economic partnership with China will supplement its current close security ties with Russia and alter Middle East power equations. China will acquire considerable influence over Tehran's nuclear and security policies, adding to its leverage with the West including the US. On the other hand, Iran's reinforced 'strategic' partnership with China will considerably enhance its capacity to promote its policy objectives in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Afghanistan. Iran may also feel sufficiently emboldened to retaliate robustly to Israel's frequent strikes on its military assets and militia affiliates in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq.

In Yemen, Iran is now playing a more open role to promote a political settlement which accommodates the Houthis. The Arab coalition has been weakened by an unsuccessful military campaign, internal differences and US and Western criticism of the human cost of the conflict.

In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad has clearly won the civil war against the Western Gulf coalition with the support of Russia and Iran. Once its economy is stabilised, Iran could play an even more robust role not only in Syria but also Iraq and Lebanon.

Iran and China may also enhance their influence in Afghanistan. Donald Trump has declared that the agreement with the Taliban is 'dead' - at least for now. The most significant provision of this agreement was not the withdrawal of 5,000 American soldiers but the Taliban's acceptance of the continued presence of 8,600 US 'counterterrorism' forces. These troops would prolong US capacity for force projection within and across Afghanistan's borders. Now, it is possible that the Afghan Taliban, perhaps at Iran's instance, may no longer accept the rump US presence in a revived deal.

China's Iran partnership would supplement and reinforce its long-standing strategic participation with Pakistan. Obviously, Beijing wants strategic relationships with both. However, the Iranian partnership offers China another strategic 'window' besides CPEC and insurance against possible US or Indian disruption of the China-Pakistan corridor. Moreover, over time, the Sino-Iran economic partnership could add a security and military dimension.Western pundits often speak of a Chinese naval base in Gwadar. In fact, it could well appear in Chahbahar.

Time is running out for India to make a strategic choice between an 'Asian Order', combining China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and Central Asia under the SCO and the BRI, or an alliance with the US and participation in its 'Indo-Pacific' strategy. So far, India has had the best of both worlds. It is building an alliance with the US to emerge as China's Asian 'equal' and establish its domination over South Asia and the Indian ocean. Yet, India pleads for US 'strategic altruism' to enable it to preserve its traditional arms supply relationship with Russia and its growing trade and investment cooperation with China. As the Sino-US global confrontation intensifies, the strategic space for India, and others, to manoeuvre between the two global powers will become progressively narrow. China's forthright support to Pakistan on occupied Kashmir is an early indication of the emerging alignments.

So far, despite Trump's hostile trade tariffs, technology restrictions and military pugnacity, China has kept open the option of reverting to a 'win-win' cooperative relationship with the US. But, a firm consensus seems to have emerged in Washington that China is America's primary rival and threat to its century of global dominance and that China's further rise can and must be stopped by a 'whole-of-government' strategy of comprehensive containment and confrontation. China appears to have picked up the gauntlet. A titanic clash is in the offing across the world.


 
 

To die for, or from

IT was the sort of over-rich chocolate cake to die for, or from. Made from imported Belgian chocolate, each layer invited gluttony. Its outer casing glistened with gold leaf. The Karachi patisserie had priced it at Rs25,000. 'Does anyone buy such a cake?' one asked. 'Many,' came the reply, 'even at Rs3,500 a slice.'

Such a lavish confection in the city of flies brought into focus the disparity between the increasingly rich and the increasingly poor in Pakistan. It is a void that government legislation cannot fill. It is met by the law of insatiable demand and inventive supply.

An incongruous analogy sprang to mind - of overpriced arms obtained over the years by Saudi Arabia from the United States and other arms-exporting countries. What can be the justification for such an extravagant outlay of petrodollars except an insatiable demand by a chequebook-happy kingdom and a supply of the latest inventive toys by the world's armaments industry?

No one is quite sure how much Saudi Arabia and now the United Arab Emirates spend to intimidate their neighbours. Arms supply is a secretive business, and the Gulf Arabs can be more reticent about their business than most. Actual figures are hidden behind a smokescreen of intent. For example, President Donald Trump announced that his son-in-law Jared Kushner had brokered an arms deal with Saudi Arabia worth $110 billion. The original Saudi demand for $15bn was not enough for Kushner. He remonstrated in the National Security Council that the US needed 'to sell them as much as possible'.

The Iranians have made a timely shift towards China.

While a fool and his money are soon parted, Kushner found it difficult to winkle such a large sum out of the Saudis. The final purchases in 2018 were closer to the Saudis' original demand. In 2019, Trump expressed his determination to push through an arms deal worth $8.5bn to Saudi Arabia.

With Saudi Arabia awash with so much lethal hardware including sophisticated surveillance systems and attack aircraft, it came as a surprise that, on Sept 14, a number of unmanned drones and missiles were able to penetrate Saudi defences with impunity and attack its Abqaiq plant and the Khurais oilfield. The Saudi oil company Aramco admitted that, as a result, it had 'suspended production of 5.7 million barrels of crude oil'. This represented 60 per cent of the kingdom's total oil output. The Saudis and the US blame the Houthi rebels and Yemen (and by association, Iran). The Iranians deny any complicity.

Regardless of who pressed the button, there was a parallel absurdity of this episode with the solo flight made by the young German Mathias Rust who, in May 1987, flew a single-engine Cessna from Helsinki to Moscow. Rust managed to dodge the Soviet Union's radars en route and to land unchallenged in Moscow's Red Square. He became famous not only for the audacity of his feat but for having exposed (single-handedly) the uselessness of the Soviets' expensive defence systems.

The casualties of Rust's escapade were the Soviet Minister of Defence Sergei Sokolov and the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Air Defences Chief Marshal Alexander Koldunov, They were dismissed by Mikhail Gorbachev (then general secretary, CPSU). One wonders who in Saudi Arabia would dare dismiss the current Saudi minister of defence? (It happens to be Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.)

The Saudis continue to be Iran's adversaries but the Iranians have insured themselves against the US-Saudi-UAE threat by a timely shift towards China. Following a visit to Beijing by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, both countries have agreed to revive an earlier understanding of cooperation. The fresh arrangement, described as 'a strategic partnership', envisages loans by China of $10bn for infrastructure projects, overdue improvements to Iran's Arak IR-40 heavy water reactor, and disbursements of US $280bn, spread over 25 years, to develop Iran's oil and gas fields.

In reciprocation, Iran has conceded to China first refusal 'to bid on any new, stalled or uncompleted oil and gas field developments'. To protect its interests, China will depute 5,000 military personnel in Iran. In addition, bilateral trade is planned to expand to $600bn over the next decade. Iran is set to become China's western 'hong'.

Someone once said that his arms were too short to fight with God. After 40 tiring years of shadow-boxing, Iran has decided that its arms are too short to fight with the US. It would prefer to use them to embrace a more amenable neighbour.

With Iran as an additional dimension of China's One Belt, One Road initiative, the dynamics of the region have changed irreversibly. Allies of the US will discover that overpriced arms, like that overpriced chocolate cake, may be nice on display but are better left un-bought.

THE rise and transformation of China over the last seven decades from an ideological state to an economic powerhouse has been both complex and impressive. It has indeed taken much blood and toil, and the journey to transform an authoritarian, largely isolated state into one of the world's major powers has not always been a smooth one.

Today as Beijing observes the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the People's Republic. Though its achievements should be celebrated, there should also be a critical review to see what can be improved internally to create greater social harmony and freedom, paired with economic prosperity.

The People's Republic was born in the aftermath of the Second World War, when the first shots of the Cold War were being fired. Led by Mao Zedong, the socialist revolutionaries defeated the nationalists and laid the groundwork for modern China. Mao, along with being the founding father of modern China, was a giant on the world stage, though his era was far from harmonious as the ravages of the Cultural Revolution showed.

This was an era of ideological zeal, when the socialist and capitalist blocs were locked in a global battle for influence. However, the modern financial strength of the PRC the country is today the world's second biggest economy is largely the handiwork of Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw great changes in the economic structure of his country and promoted the development of 'socialism with Chinese characteristics'.

Today, China is socialist in all but name, though there has been a renewed focus by the state on Marxism under the helmsmanship of Xi Jinping. The current Chinese president has also been pushing economic growth, the Belt and Road Initiative being his signature project. Under the BRI, China is seeking to link continents in a web of trade and commerce, with Pakistan also benefiting in the shape of CPEC.

While the PRC's journey has been a success story, especially where economic growth and military strength are concerned, there are legitimate concerns about the state of human rights within China. For example, numerous foreign media outlets have highlighted the situation in Xinjiang, particularly with respect to the Muslim Uighur ethnic group. There have been claims that the Turkic Uighurs are being forced by Beijing to abandon their religious and cultural practices, though the state denies this. The unrest in Hong Kong also refuses to die down, as protesters have been taking to the streets in the former British colony for several months now.

It is easy to brush aside these criticisms, but if China is to truly reap the harvest of its economic achievements, there must be internal harmony, with all nationalities given their due rights under the law, and greater freedoms for the Chinese people. Looking ahead, these would be worthy goals for leaders of the PRC to pursue.


 
 

Experts discuss prospects of Pakistan's regional connectivity

Speakers at an international conference on Monday stopped short of highlighting the future course of Pakistan to make best out of the upcoming developments.

Board of Investment (BoI) Chairman Haroon Sharif said Pakistan had a geographical edge over other regional countries but 'Where do we fail?'

He added: 'Our problem is that we outsource our thinking either to China or the International Financial Institutions (IFIs). Our diplomats are great but they need to be sitting in Beijing, Kuala Lumpur and Tashkent rather than Geneva and New York.'

The conference on 'Afghanistan, Regional Geo-Politics and Trade Connectivity' was organised by Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS). Experts from US, China, Afghanistan and Pakistan participated in the conference.

Former US diplomat James Schwemlein explained the US stance on the regional dynamics and the Afghan war.

He said the US had many lessons from its military intervention in Afghanistan, one being that its leverage is 'now a deteriorating asset'. It could have made better deals with Taliban in the past than it is in any position to do so now.

'Further, the US has suffered from unclear objectives which were failed to be articulated as well as resourced,' Mr Schwemlein said, adding: 'I hope that we can form a positive relationship which is favourable to Pakistan, Afghanistan and the US interests. I hope we talk about market economy, climate change, education, and find more ways to work together.'

Centre for Development and Peace Studies (CDPS) director general Intizar Khadim said Afghanistan had always been at the centre of geo-politics as it lies at the crossroads of regional connectivity.

He said in the current age of connectivity, a new term had emerged that was 'glocalised' - not to be mixed with 'globalised,' he clarified.

'Today's human is global and local at the same time, so there has to be a mixed approach just imposing an alien approach to an indigenous problem cannot solve the issues,' he said.

Giving the Chinese perspective, Zhou Shuai, lecturer at Beijing International Studies University, said the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was the global vision of infrastructural connectivity and a conception of 21st century multi-polarity. It would not be an exaggeration to state that it is one of the most significant game-changing endeavours ever to be attempted in the contemporary times.

'The economic pull of BRI works as an irresistible magnet to exploit its regional connectivity in stimulating trade objectives, whether it is furthering bilateral trade with China such as the European Union (EU), Mideast and African states may naturally be interested in or in procuring an expedient outlet to the Indian Ocean

such as what Russia and the Central Asian republics desire. Hence, through this endeavour, the BRI ensures regional as well as global economic development,' Mr Shuai said.


 
 

Taliban at a crossroads

THE Afghan Taliban appear to be at a crossroads again. They are to decide on a future political strategy without losing too much of their militant strength. So far, the Taliban leadership had been anticipating that the peace process would result in victory for them. Indeed, they entered into talks with the US with a sense of victory, and proved themselves hard negotiators.

They were fully prepared to enter the streets of Kabul like a victorious 'army', but President Donald Trump shattered their dream at the eleventh hour by [calling off][2] his 'secret' meeting with a Taliban delegation at Camp David, which many believed would be the venue for a peace agreement. This was perhaps the Taliban leadership's weakest moment. They had been so close to the finish line.

Many feared the peace process could fall apart. The Taliban reached out to all their channels of support, including in Moscow and Beijing, and most importantly in Islamabad; they were advised by all to return to the peace process. The advice worked and the presidential election in Afghanistan was not as bloody as before, indicating the militia was ready to scale down the level of violence if peace talks resumed.

Apparently, the Taliban have not yet worked out a post-peace deal strategy in terms of how they will transform their war machinery into a political asset. So far, they have been set on capitalising on foreign troops' withdrawal and devising a power-sharing formula with other stakeholders in Afghanistan. They were confident that they would easily broker a deal and gain power, which would also allow them to bring their fighters from the rural areas into the cities. However, political processes have their own dynamics.

Apparently, the Taliban have not yet worked out a post-peace deal strategy.

The Taliban delegation led by Mullah Baradar, which visited Islamabad recently, held some important meetings, further indicating a softening of the Taliban stance. The delegation met Prime Minister Imran Khan and Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, but the reported meeting with the US envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, was even more significant. A US official denied that these developments signalled the resumption of the peace process. It is apparent that the US itself wants to decide when talks would restart.

It is not certain whether they will resume from the point at which they fell apart or if both sides will renegotiate specific terms. The US can insist on a ceasefire and acknowledge the next administration in Kabul as a legitimate actor in the conflict. The Taliban will resist any change in the agreed draft. Can Pakistan urge them to renegotiate?

It could a deliberate attempt by Trump to bring the Taliban under pressure, and for now, the effort has proved useful. However, the US has limited options in Afghanistan. A unilateral US withdrawal will also intensify the conflict on multiple internal fronts and encourage external actors to have proxies. Though the status quo suits Kabul, this is not going to end the war. The only option left for the Afghan government is to pursue a negotiated settlement with stakeholders, including the Taliban.

The US, too, cannot continue to use delaying tactics to keep the Taliban under pressure. But it is Pakistan's position that is extremely delicate because of what's happening in India-held Kashmir and it seems willing to extend all-out support to the US in the Afghan peace process. In return, Pakistan wants its ties with the US to be normalised in order to consolidate its geo-economic and strategic support while confronting India. Immediate support is required to keep Kashmir in the global political conversation. If Trump continues to offer mediation, it will serve the purpose and build pressure on India.

An idea that is shared by some policy circles in Islamabad is that the zero-tolerance approach exhibited by Pakistan against all shades of militants has weakened the Indian argument of linking Pakistan with terrorism at international forums. India's economic, political, and strategic profile is strong, and most nations want to do business with India, but Pakistan's new strategy of abandoning its previous policy on Kashmir might frustrate it.

In retaliation, India could go for a limited military adventure against Pakistan to hurt the latter economically and politically. This perception could be based on fear, and Pakistan's cooperation with the US on Afghanistan may prevent India from getting too brazen.

Pakistan has its compulsions, but China is also keenly monitoring the situation in Afghanistan. The unilateral withdrawal of US troops will be a nightmare scenario for China, which is why it fully supports the peace process between the US and the Taliban. China is not ready to take any leadership role in the resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan, while it also fears that if the peace process collapses, the spillover effect will add to Chinese problems in the adjoining Xinjiang province.

Instability in Afghanistan could destabilise the region, thus affecting the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. But Chinese experts are more worried about CPEC. Any regional instability will hurt the initiative and may force Pakistan to put its geo-strategic priorities before the emerging regional geo-economics.

China wants the US to accomplish its peace mission in Afghanistan. In any worst-case scenario, China would prefer to use the regional platform, preferably the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, to drive negotiations.

Prime Minister Imran Khan is visiting China soon. Apart from addressing CPEC-related issues, he will discuss peace in Afghanistan with the Chinese leadership. The prospects of a probable change of administration in Kabul and the new dispensation's attitude towards the peace process may also come under discussion. It seems both will encourage the Afghan Taliban to go with the peace process in Afghanistan.

If the Taliban agree on even a temporary ceasefire, it would be an excellent achievement for all. But the Taliban will have to face another challenge: that of convincing their field commanders about the victory they claimed after the first stage of the peace process. The Taliban have not lost much yet, but the militia's fate will depend on their future plans.

Pakistan and China have reaffirmed their resolve to 'further deepen strategic communication and strengthen all-weather cooperation' aimed at building a community of shared future in the new era, as Prime Minister Imran Khan and Chinese President Xi Jinping exchanged views on a wide range of bilateral, regional and global issues during their meeting on Wednesday.

At the meeting held at the People's Great Hall of China, the Chinese president extended Beijing's 'unwavering support to Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity'.

Recalling the Joint Statement of Nov 4, 2018, which outlined the important consensus between Pakistan and China, the two sides reaffirmed their support on issues concerning each other's core interests.

The Chinese president, who is scheduled to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Chennai later this week, told Mr Khan that he was watching the situation in Kashmir very closely and would support Pakistan 'on all issues of its core national interest'. The Chinese leadership said the Kashmir issue was a dispute left from history, and should be properly and peacefully resolved based on the UN Charter, UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. 'China opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation. The two sides underlined that a peaceful, stable, cooperative and prosperous South Asia was in common interest of all parties. Parties need to settle disputes and issues in the region through dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect,' said a statement issued by the PM Office following the meeting.

Tensions over Kashmir have risen sharply since Aug 5 when New Delhi revoked the autonomy of the disputed region and imposed a curfew.

Beijing offers support on Kashmir, other core issues; Islamabad terms Hong Kong affairs China's internal matter

Mr Khan discussed the continued lockdown of millions of Kashmiris for more than two months that created a dire humanitarian situation in the Valley and stressed the urgency for lifting of curfew in India-held Kashmir to alleviate the sufferings of the Kashmiris and to avert risks to regional peace and security.

As the Chinese leadership reiterated solidarity with Pakistan in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty, independence and security, the Pakistan side reaffirmed its commitment to the One-China Policy. 'Supporting One Country Two Systems', Pakistan reiterated that affairs of Hong Kong were China's internal matter and all countries should uphold international law and basic norms of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries.

On Afghanistan, the two sides reaffirmed that there was no military solution to the situation and expressed the resolve to continue to support peace and reconciliation process. They agreed that a peaceful and stable Afghanistan would promote economic development and connectivity in the region. Both sides also expressed satisfaction at the outcome of the Third China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers' Dialogue held in Islamabad on Sept 7. 'An inclusive, and Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process' would be the key for peace and stability in the country, the two sides maintained.

About the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Prime Minister Khan told President Xi that Pakistan had established CPEC Authority to oversee the expeditious implementation of projects. He said the visionary Belt and Road Initiative would play a transformational role in accelerating Pakistan's economic development and promoting regional connectivity and prosperity.

Mr Khan said Pakistan had come out of the difficult economic situation. 'We will never forget China's financial cooperation in this regard,' he said, adding that China had never asked anything in return for supporting Pakistan's national interest as it extended unconditional help to the country.

Lauding Pakistan's efforts to expeditiously execute CPEC projects, President Xi stressed that it would help national and regional economic development process. He appreciated Islamabad's efforts in combating terrorism and maintained that Pakistan through institutional and economic reforms was resolutely and promisingly on the way to substantial economic development.

The two sides agreed that early implementation of the second phase of the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement would contribute to increase in bilateral trade. They agreed to take full advantage of the China-Pakistan Joint Economic and Trade Commission (CPJETC) to achieve balanced and sustainable development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation. They maintained that the ninth session of the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) to be held in November in Islamabad would fast-track implementation of the ongoing projects and explore new avenues of cooperation. The two sides underlined that Chinese investment in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and collaboration in SME sector would further expand Pakistan's industrial base and diversify its export base.

They agreed to jointly study the projects identified by Pakistan in power, petroleum, gas, agriculture, industrial and infrastructure sectors. Those projects were entrusted to the relevant Joint Working Groups (JWGs) for deliberation and subsequent consideration by the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) next month.

The two sides exchanged views on cooperation in the areas of trade, investment, finance, defence and security, education, agriculture, social sector, people-to-people contact and cultural linkages.

They reaffirmed their commitment to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and called on all countries to strengthen international cooperation on counterterrorism. China appreciated Pakistan's unrelenting efforts and tremendous sacrifices in countering terrorism. It supported Pakistan in implementing its National Action Plan and called on the international community to recognise Pakistan's contributions to regional peace and security through its success in fight against terrorism.

Both sides expressed satisfaction over the close cooperation between the two countries at multilateral fora and resolved to deepen strategic coordination and consultation. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and support for multilateralism and win-win cooperation.

Later, the Chinese president hosted lunch in honour of Pakistan's premier, who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Minister for Planning, Development and Reforms Khusro Bakhtyar, Minister of Railways Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Commerce Adviser Abdul Razak Dawood, PM's Special Assistant on Petroleum Nadeem Babar and Chairman of the Board of Investment Zubair Gilani, Chief of the Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence Lt Gen Faiz Hameed and senior officials.


 
 

Pakistan signs MoU with  China  on assistive technology

Pakistan has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on improving access to assistive technology with China which will not only benefit disabled people in both countries but millions of those living in countries that are part of the Belt and Road Initiative.

China has the largest number of disabled people (86 million) and the world's largest and most influential Chinese Disabled People's Federation (CDPF) and world's largest assistive technology industry.

In June last year World Health Assembly (WHA) unanimously passed a resolution about improving access to assistive technology for the disabled, elderly and those with non-communicable diseases and made it mandatory for all 194 countries to implement the resolution within four years.

The resolution was tabled by Pakistan, in Geneva, and co-sponsored by 35 countries such as China, Germany, the US and others so the responsibility of Pakistan, to implement, had further increased.

Assistive devices and technologies are those whose primary purpose is to maintain or improve an individual's functioning and independence to facilitate participation and to enhance overall well-being. They can also help prevent impairments and secondary health conditions. Examples of assistive devices and technologies include wheelchairs, prostheses, hearings aids, visual aids, and specialised computer software and hardware that increase mobility, hearing, vision or communication capacities.

At present, it is estimated that in low-income and middle-income countries, only 5-15pc of people who require assistive devices and technologies have access to them. So WHO has made a list of 50 assistive devices and suggested to provide to people free of cost.

According to a statement, issued by the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS), the MoU was signed by Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Health Dr Zafar Mirza in the presence of the prime ministers of Pakistan and China, at a ceremony held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

The MoU was one of the three MoUs signed by the two countries during Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to China. Pakistani disabled people would benefit and so would our emerging industry in this area through industrial cooperation, the special assistant said.

He said this will further enhance the existing bilateral relations, friendship and cooperation between the two countries especially in the field of Public Health and Medical Research to promote health services for the welfare of the people of Pakistan.

Dr Mirza will also be speaking at a high-level event on Assistive Technology today (Thursday) in Beijing.


 
 

A deafening silence

IMAGINE a scenario in which a Western country locks up hundreds of thousands of Muslims in internment camps. Here, they are 're-educated' to adopt liberal values that include a change of language and lifestyle.

Had such a deliberate effort to brainwash an entire Muslim community been attempted, there would be riots and protests across the Islamic world. Embassies of the country responsible for this outrage would be attacked, and its businesses boycotted. We know from experience that this sequence of events is pretty much standard operating procedure whenever real or perceived acts of state-organised violence against Muslims take place.

Also read: In China's Xinjiang, Big Brother moves into Uighur homes as 'family'

So why the deafening silence across the Islamic world when around 1.5 million Muslims in China's Xinjiang province have been forced into vast 're-education centres'? Even before this policy was launched, Uighur culture was under attack, with beards and headscarves strongly discouraged by an increasingly harsh Chinese administration. It is now virtually impossible to find books in the Uighur language in bookshops.

Around half the province's population of 24m is Sunni, and largely follows the Sufi tradition. Apart from Uighurs, there are Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui and other minorities in Xinjiang. Ever since the government in Beijing began its policy of moving Han Chinese to the province to dilute the Muslim presence, Uighur separatist groups have resisted and staged sporadic attacks. As often happens, the state has countered with tough action and policies.

The ummah's response to the Uighurs' plight is puzzling.

The aim of the Chinese government is to 'transform through education'. For thousands of years, the Chinese ruling class has sought to build a stable society free of tension between various ethnic groups. So when a handful of Uighur resisted the attempt to integrate them into mainstream Han culture, they were accused of separatism and subversion. One such group is the Uighur mother-tongue movement: the authorities have dubbed it the 'fourth evil' after separatism, religious extremism and terrorism.

One example of China's historic policy of standardising rules across the country is that despite spanning five time zones, it only has a single standard Beijing time. This leads to anomalies such as Kashgar in the west having to follow the same time as the capital. So the sun can be shining while the clock shows 9 pm.

While the policy of brainwashing the Uighur has been widely criticised in the west as 'cultural genocide', Muslims have been largely silent. One reason for this hypocritical approach is the clout China wields. For Pakistan, China has been the bedrock of our foreign policy, as well as our economic saviour. It is also an important importer of Saudi and Iranian oil. And other developing Muslim countries have benefited from Chinese aid and loans. All these factors have served to mute criticism of Beijing's assault on Uighur religion and culture.

But just as important is the pivotal role Xinjiang is expected to play in China's Belt and Road Initiative. Roads and railway lines from various points around the world will carry thousands of containers, and China is nervous about any disruption caused by separatist groups. It has already seen how such terrorism can affect infrastructure projects in Balochistan.

China denies that it is trying to brainwash the Muslim population of Xinjiang, but government spokesmen have admitted to a policy of training and educating the young. In many cases, children have been separated from parents to be placed in these centres where they are indoctrinated and forced to learn Mandarin Chinese. More and more, a single, monolithic Han culture is being forced on minorities. Muslims, in particular, are at the sharp end of this policy.

Xinjiang means 'new frontier', and was given this name when the vast region was conquered by the Qing dynasty in the 18th century after a series of bloody battles. How­ever, this conquest was resisted by warlords who regained control of various areas from time to time. In fact, for a short time, they set up the Republic of East Turkestan.

Since then, there has been friction between Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, and Beijing. And as the stakes have risen, so has the level of repression. Electronic surveillance has been a key element in this crackdown. Locals have been forced to hand over mobile phones so that their sim cards can be read by the police. Security forces at innumerable check posts stop and search locals and foreigners alike, and CCTV cameras check their photographs against a central databank.

The victims of these human rights violations have no right of appeal. China is a one-party dictatorship. In its long history, there hasn't been a single period when democracy was practised. To a large extent, people accept a strong central government that has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty in a single generation.

But the attitude of the ummah is surprising: both on the left and right, Muslims have been like the proverbial ostriches.


 
 

 China  keen to invest in Halal meat industry

Leader of a Chinese delegation Zhu Maa has shown interest in investing in Halal meat industry in Pakistan and exporting it to China and Middle Eastern countries.

Mr Zhu said this during a meeting with Minister for States and Frontier Regions and Narcotics Control Shehryar Khan Afridi.

According to a statement issued by the ministry on Sunday, the delegation from Sichuan Province has also a number of Muslims.

Saying China has good equipment and services, Mr Zhu vowed to showcase Pakistani products and Halal food in Chinese markets.

'I have visited Pakistan around half a dozen times and each time it was a great experience. People of both countries are very friendly. There is a need to project opportunities for investment in Pakistan to Chinese people,' he said.

Minister says one-window service for foreign investors has been introduced

The minister said that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has created opportunities for the underdeveloped countries to rise like China.

'Chinese President Xi Jinping's vision will benefit the underdeveloped countries to join the world and they will rise with help from BRI,' he said.

Mr Afridi said the PTI government had launched a reforms process in Pakistan so it could be open for foreign investors.

'China and its people live in our hearts. Chinese people stood for Pakistan since day one. It gives me immense delight that I am meeting Muslims of China who believe in one God and faith.'

He said that China's unprecedented rise reflects that a strong nation can get all parts of the country along and this is how President Xi has done wonders with his poverty alleviation campaign.

'We salute and cherish the way the Chinese government has got 800 million people out of poverty. Today China is an inspiration for the entire globe,' he added.

The minister said that Pakistan provided firm support to China during Ping Pong diplomacy and helped it become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and it (Pakistan) is still with China when it has become a great world leader.

'It is unfortunate that Pakistan's image has been replicated negatively. I hope after watching Pakistan closely you would become ambassadors of Pakistan and tell Chinese nation how peaceful and loving Pakistanis are,' he said.

Mr Afridi said that due to Chairman Mao Zedong leadership and Deng Xiaopeng's reform agenda, China has become one of the greatest economic giants of the world.

'Entrepreneurship is the way of Sunnah of Holy prophets. Pakistan is blessed with all resources. We have all seasons and we are blessed with our youths and we have rich mineral resources and fertile lands. Return on investment is much higher in Pakistan in the entire region and our government has opened Pakistan for international investors to come and invest here,' he said.

The minister said that Pakistan has rich resources of religious tourism and it has most out of 14 top mountains.

'Kohat is oil and gas producing district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Our manpower is doing wonders across the globe. One-window service for foreign investors has been introduced and the World Bank has declared Pakistan top country in Asia in Ease of Doing Business policy,' he said.

'Every single penny you invest here will be taken care of by Pakistan government. More people in Pakistan are now learning Chinese and inter-marriages are taking place,' the minister said.

Military will continue to shape security, foreign policy: report

The Pakistan Army will continue to shape the country's foreign and security policy, a forecast report released by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said this week, adding that the governing PTI-led coalition is expected to be largely amenable to this arrangement.

'As a result, relations between the civilian government and the military will be positive,' added the report published by the research and analysis division of The Economist Group, the sister company to The Economist newspaper.

The report outlined Pakistan's political and economic outlook for the period of 2020 to 2024 and forecast that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) would serve its full term while opposition parties would remain in a state of disarray owing to legal challenges facing their leaders.

EIU says PTI govt will complete its term; forecasts slow economic growth

With regard to the PPP and PML-N, the report noted that the opposition would coordinate strategies against the government in an effort that would likely result in frequent obstruction to legislative proceedings in parliament. It added that while these moves against Prime Minister Imran Khan would increase pressure on his government, the EIU did not believe they would challenge the PTI's grip on power.

'Our view assumes that the military (including its intelligence wing) - which has a lengthy history of intervening in politics - will continue to provide tacit support to the government, partly by using its extra-constitutional influence over the country's judicial institutions. It will also continue to exert sway over Mr Khan's administration, especially when it comes to its foreign and security policies. As long as the PTI enjoys the support of the military, its junior partners are unlikely to abandon the ruling coalition to join the opposition,' the report said.

It added that while China would remain Pakistan's main strategic and economic partner in this period, ties with India would remain strained as cross-border terrorism and the dispute over occupied Kashmir 'impede the normalisation of relations'.

Economic outlook

The report noted that while improvements had been made, the security situation would remain a source of instability for the forecast period. 'It will undermine growth potential by posing operational and strategic challenges to infrastructure projects and business investment,' the report read.

The EIU predicted that Pakistan's real GDP would expand by an annual average of 3.1 per cent in fiscal years 2019/20- 2023/24 (July-June).

'Growth will slow owing to a tightening of monetary policy and acceleration in inflation, which will crimp purchasing power. A financial assistance package from the IMF, together with loans from other multilateral and bilateral donors, will help ease the strained balance-of-payments situation over the next few years, although the current account will remain in deficit in 2020 to 2024,' it said.

It expected the government's efforts to address balance of payments pressures to have a 'dampening effect on economic expansion'.

'We believe that the combination of a heavier tax burden across the economy and weaker government spending on public services will dampen economic activity. Moreover, inflationary pressures will weigh on the purchasing power of citizens, depressing consumption growth. These factors, combined with a tight monetary environment, will hamper investment and economic growth,' it said.

It also said that under the IMF programme, the government would significantly cut planned development spending, which mainly involved infrastructure projects. The EIU expected growth in both private and government consumption to slow significantly in 2019 to 2020.

Policy-making

The EIU noted that the PTI was elected on an 'ambitious policy agenda' that included expanding social services, housing construction and job creation. But it predicted that Pakistan's macroeconomic frailty would prevent much of this from being achieved.

'The party's promises appear especially optimistic in view of the fiscal and balance-of-payments challenges facing the government. Poverty-alleviation schemes such as the Ehsaas programme, launched by Mr Khan in March, will have limited success,' the report said.

Despite strong opposition from entrenched interests within state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the EIU expected the government - at the IMF's insistence - to make gradual progress on privatisation. The process, it said, would remain fraught with political complications, as many SOEs were overstaffed and successful restructuring would involve severe job losses. Moreover, regulatory inefficiencies, complex labour laws and an unreliable security situation would continue to weigh on the business environment, which would remain poor in 2020-24. Some attempts to reform the country's inefficient bureaucracy were likely, but progress would be slow, it added.

Ties with China

The report forecast that China would remain Pakistan's leading economic and strategic partner in 2020 to 20­24.

'Despite fiscal constraints and some hesitation over debt obligations associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - which is of major strategic importance to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) - China will remain the largest source of foreign investment, as well as a key strategic ally. Although China's ongoing efforts to make the BRI more sustainable will limit financing for CPEC projects going forward, we do not expect this to affect broader China-Pakistan ties,' the report said.

Pakistan needs to learn from how China pulled its people out of poverty using artificial intelligence, 5G, biotechnology, quantum computing and other technological spheres, speakers said at the inauguration of the 3rd Annual Conference of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Consortium of CPEC Universities.

The two-day conference was inaugurated on Monday under the aegis of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) at the Jinnah Convention Centre. The theme for this year's conference is 'Academic Collaboration for Sustainable Partnerships'.

The CPEC Consortium of Universities was created in August 2017 and initially named the CPEC Consortium of Business Schools, to promote business-to-business links between China and Pakistan and study the relocation of Chinese businesses to planned industrial parks in Pakistan under CPEC.

The initiative was launched by the HEC and the China Association of Higher Education (CAHE). The scope of the consortium has been widened to cover all major domains of higher education, and it now includes 56 universities from both countries.

Conference of CPEC universities' consortium inaugurated

Speaking at the event, Minister for Planning, Development and Reform Makhdoom Khusro Bukhtiar hoped that collaboration under the consortium's banner would broaden the scope of bilateral relations between Pakistan and China.

He said various components covered by the consortium would improve people-to-people contact.

The academic community's role through the consortium would pave the way for economic growth, as this coincides with the fourth industrial revolution, he said.

'Universities should carry out diagnostic studies of all crucial sectors as this will unleash the potential areas in which Pakistan needs to conduct research and come up with sustainable solutions. There is need for promoting broad-based cooperation and synergy to jointly work in different fields including data science, artificial intelligence, technology, agriculture,' he said.

Ambassador of China Yao Jing said that CPEC projects, including the CPEC Consortium of Universities, are recent manifestations of strong bilateral relations. He said the consortium is a vital platform to connect people of both the countries.

Strategic Policy Planning Cell Chairman Dr Moeed Yousuf said this is the age of global connectivity, in which the consortium of universities will play an important role in the execution of CPEC and Belt and Road initiatives.

He encouraged universities to research important national issues and bring their findings to the Strategic Policy Planning Cell.

'Academics play an important role in informing policymakers in what works and what doesn't. I encourage institutions of higher learning to come up with solutions to our national problems so that the same may be presented to policymakers,' he said.

HEC CPEC consultant retired Lt Gen Mohammad Asghar said Pakistan needs to learn from how China lifted its population out of poverty.

He added that the CPEC Consortium of Universities is a common platform for Pakistan and China to collaborate on a large number of areas focused on socioeconomic development.

He said that various sessions of the conference will review progress of academic collaborations among partner institutions, identify new areas of cooperation for the development of human resource, seek ways to expand academic links among universities from both countries, promote harmony and invigorate people-to-people contacts, explore joint research projects and areas of convergence, plan joint conferences, seminars and workshops, strive for the internationalisation of higher education, and support the historic transition under CPEC.

The conference also includes a Higher Education, Science, Arts and Technology Expo where the participating universities have displayed their products.

Three parallel sessions were held on the first day: Developing Research Universities for Lead Role in National Development, Teaching Excellence for Employability of Graduates and Research Management to Solve National and Regional Challenges with a Focus on CPEC.

Politically stable and secure Pakistan is vital for uninterrupted investment flow and smooth economic activities, says Chinese diplomat Peng Zhengwu at a discussion held at Punjab University's Pakistan Study Centre here on Tuesday.

'A stable political system matters a lot. It ensures free flow of movement and hassle-free business opportunities,' said the deputy consul general, calling for more welcoming atmosphere for Chinese investors to help reboot the local economy.

He said foreigners coming to Pakistan should also be allowed movement, choice of their foods, availability of cost-effective residence and reasonable commutations to make environment conducive for investors and the general public.

The CPEC, a signature project of the Belt and Road Initiative, was a path to realise the dream of seamless industrial growth, joint ventures, socio-economic progress, agriculture development, cultural connectivity, peace and prosperity in the region, he said.

Foreign affairs expert Muhammad Mehdi who chaired the sitting said though sky is the limit for improvement, there still are things needing attention to take Pakistan-China relations and the CPEC to new heights in the face of a barrage of challenges. He lauded the statement of Lijian Zhao, deputy director-general of information department at the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for hailing the Lahore High Court verdict allowing former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to travel abroad for treatment.

He suggested that as part of Panda Diplomacy observed by China globally, Beijing should donate Pandas to the Lahore Zoo to win hearts of people.

Sichuan University (China) Director Song Zhihui said that politically both Pakistan and China were fine but economically still there was lot of room to do more. He highlighted China's booming demand for Pakistani mangoes, rice and other fruits asking the local exporters to fully capitalise on the opportunity.

He said Chinese entrepreneurs were looking for potential partners in Pakistan to start joint ventures in building material and cost-effective house construction.

Punjab University Pro-VC Azhar Saleem called for more people-friendly Chinese visa policy by granting visas with multiple entries and longer periods as practiced globally.

Dean Faculty of Arts Dr Iqbal Chawla talked of strength of mutual relations irrespective of the change in international and regional dynamics, while Prof Amjad Magsi said that successive Pakistani governments considered ties with China as the cornerstone of their foreign policies.

Former Supreme Court Judge Justice Faqir Muhammad Khokhar highlighted the importance of formation of the CPEC Authority and underlined the need for technical training for local manpower by Chinese experts in the field of agriculture.

Senior journalist Altaf Hassan Qureshi emphasised on extensive people to people contact, literary and cultural cooperation.

Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Wednesday called for promoting interdependence among countries for making the world safer and prosperous instead of seeking kinetic solutions of security problems.

He was speaking at the inaugural session of a two-day international conference at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI).

'The exclusive focus of global and regional powers on the military and security dimensions of what is happening in Asia will be short-sighted. The BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) and its flagship projects like CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor), offer a ray of hope that inclusive and pluralistic solutions would make our world safer, securer and more prosperous,' Mr Qureshi said.

The minister noted that many security issues could be resolved through economic collaboration instead of kinetic means.

'We, therefore, need to make a concerted effort for a paradigm shift away from security-driven agenda.... (and towards) inter-dependence and connectivity,' he said.

He was of the opinion that the much-needed paradigm shift could be achieved through China's BRI project and its associated projects like CPEC.

Mr Qureshi said the four major issues facing the region were: the US-China competition, especially trade-related issues; US-Iran tensions; instability in Afghanistan; and an over-reaching and Hindutva-driven India.

These issues, he said, could badly affect regional peace and security, besides hampering economic development.

ISSI Director General Amb Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry, while deliberating on the shifting regional dynamics, said a great power tussle could spell an end to old globalism, while giving birth to its newer version.

He added that BRI and CPEC could help navigate contemporary challenges.

Punjab University's (PU) Pakistan Study Centre on Wednesday held a seminar on Pakistan-China relations and China's poverty alleviation model and how Pakistan can rid its population of poverty.

Sichuan University Pakistan Study Centre Director Prof Song Zhi Hui, PU Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Saleem Mazhar, PU Faculty of Arts Dean and Pakistan Study Centre Director Prof Dr Muhammad Iqbal Chawla and Dr Amjad Magsi were present on the occasion.

Dr Magsi highlighted the significance of recent developments in Pakistan China relations and Prof Chawla shed light on China's emergence as second largest economic power of the world.

He said China had surprised the world with its successful poverty alleviation strategy and was playing an important role for global peace and prosperity.

He said the US was feeling the heat of the rise of China after the inception of One Belt, One Road in 2013 and was trying to hamper the growth and advancement of China in global economic arena with the help of India.

Prof Hui focused on poverty alleviation and China-Pakistan cooperation and explained the methodologies and strategies adopted for the successful poverty alleviation. He said since 1978, all the sectors were developing and poverty alleviation was one of the most striking ones. 'The programme has lifted over 800 million people in a period of 40 years and around 17 million people were freed on average from poverty per year or 1.4 million in month or 46,000 a day or 1,900 an hour,' he said.

He elaborated the methodologies adopted for poverty alleviation, including small-scale relief, systematical push, large-scale development, whole village assistance and precise alleviation of poverty. Pakistan had a huge potential in the economic field and its economy was emerging fast in recent years, which could bring a bright future for the country and the whole region.

He emphasised that improvement in infrastructure, creation of job opportunities, increase of taxes and revenue will go a long way in poverty alleviation in Pakistan. 'The CPEC will bring so many opportunities for economic development, like jobs,' he added.

He said industrial relocation, agricultural development and tourism promotion should be focused on. He also said education, vocational training and talent cultivation in the people were key factors in development for alleviating poverty.

A memorandum of understanding was signed to set up a branch of Institute of Belt and Road, Sichuan University at PU Pakistan Study Centre. Under the agreement, both the Centres would develop academic cooperation through faculty-student exchange and joint research projects.


 
 

CPEC to push Pakistan deeper into debt burden, cautions US

The United States has warned Pakistan that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would push the country deeper into an already stifling debt burden, foster corruption and repatriate jobs and profits to China.

In a speech, described as 'unusually specific' by the international media, the top US diplomat for South Asia warned on Thursday that the multi-billion-dollar project would take a toll on Pakistan's economy at the time of repayments and dividend in the coming years.

Assistant Secretary Alice Wells explained that CPEC was not an aid to Pakistan but a form of financing that guarantees profits for Chinese state-owned enterprises, with little benefits for Islamabad.

As an international media report pointed out, this specific warning comes at a time when Washington and Islamabad are trying to rebuild their turbulent relationship.

Addressing a gathering of diplomats, scholars and journalists at a Washington think tank, the Wilson Center, Ms Wells also quoted specific examples from the project.

Alice Wells says multibillion-dollar project will take a toll on Pakistan's economy at the time of repayments

'CPEC's most expensive single project is upgrading the railway from Karachi to Peshawar. When the project was initially announced, the price was set at $8.2 billion,' she said.

'In October of 2018, Pakistan's railways minister announced that they had negotiated the price down to $6.2 billion, a saving of two billion. And he explained Pakistan is a poor country. We cannot afford this huge burden of these loans.'

'But recent media reports claim the price is now risen to $9 billion,' she added. 'So, why doesn't the Pakistani public know the price for CPEC's most expensive project or how it's being determined?'

The US diplomat also underlined the long-term effects in Pakistan of China's 'financing practices' and urged Islamabad to examine 'the burdens that are falling on the new government to manage with now an estimated $15 billion debt to the Chinese government and $6.7 billion in Chinese commercial debt'.

Ms Wells also emphasised the need for Pakistan to know that China was providing loans, not grants, as the United States.

'It's clear or needs to be clear that CPEC is not about aid. This is almost always the form of loans or other forms of financing, often non-concessional with sovereign guarantees or guaranteed profits for Chinese state-own enterprises that are repatriated to China,' she said.

'Now, together with non-CPEC Chinese debts payments, China is going to take a growing toll on the Pakistan economy, especially when the bulk of payment starts to come due in the next four to six years.'

Ms Wells warned that even if loan payments were deferred, 'they are going to hang over Pakistan's economic development potential, hamstringing Prime Minister (Imran) Khan's reform agenda.'

Directly addressing the alleged lack of transparency in CPEC projects, she said this could increase projects costs and foster corruption, resulting in a heavier debt burden for the country.

Ms Wells also challenged the notion that CPEC would create jobs in Pakistan. 'CPEC relies primarily on Chinese workers and supplies, even amid rising unemployment in Pakistan,' she said.

The US diplomat also demanded more transparency on the proposed link between Gwadar Port and China's Xinjiang while responding to a question that New Delhi saw this as a military project aimed at encircling India.

She said that while CPEC would only benefit China, the United States offered a better model and urged Islamabad to introduce economic reforms that would encourage US investors to invest in Pakistan.

She also recalled that during PM Khan's July visit to the White House, US President Donald Trump had offered to greatly enhance American trade with Pakistan.

Ms Wells acknowledged that the United States could not offer investments from state-run companies. But, she added, the private US investment, coupled with grants, would improve Pakistan's troubled economy.

'There is a different model,' she said. 'Worldwide we see that US companies bring more than just capital; they bring values, processes and expertise that build the capacities of local economies.'

She pointed to interest in Pakistan by US companies including Uber, Exxon Mobil, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, with the soft-drink makers together investing $1.3 billion in the country.

Her speech appeared linked to a major offensive that Washington has recently launched against Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, a signature project of President Xi Jinping which aims to build ports, highways and railways around the world.

Launching Clean Green Pakistan Index (CGPI) as part of his government's efforts to curb pollution and reduce the impact of climate change, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday criticised the previous governments of Punjab for rising pollution in Lahore and nearby cities.

Indirectly lashing out at the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) that ruled Punjab for over the past decade, PM Khan said: 'More than 70 per cent trees in Lahore have been axed and a concrete jungle has been created there over the past decade.'

Speaking at the CGPI launching ceremony, Mr Khan said: 'Lahore has reached close to New Delhi in terms of pollution rate, but nobody had thought about it.'

In the initial phase of the CGPI, 19 cities including Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawal­pindi, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Sahiwal, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Okara and Bahawalpur have been selected to compete on certain issues of public interest. They will be judged on addressing issues such as safe drinking water, solid waste management, liquid waste management, city beautification, cleanliness of streets, usability of parks, tree plantation, total sanitation/hygiene and community participation.

Launches Clean Green Pakistan project with focus on province

The PM reaffirmed his commitment to making Pakistan 'clean and green' and urged the masses to join in the efforts. The concept of 'Naya Pakistan' will change the country's destiny, he said. 'The change of Naya Pakistan will first come into the minds of people and then on the ground,' he explained.

He recalled that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had planted one billion trees in five years.

Adviser to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam said that students and youth were being encouraged to join the campaign. Services of people, who would register themselves for and participate in the CGPI, would be rewarded by the government, Mr Aslam announced.

Sharing future plans to protect the environment, the adviser said the government aimed to introduce electric cars to reduce harmful emissions.

He said the government had introduced multiple campaigns and drives to combat climate change, including the billion trees tsunami and Clean Green Pakistan.

MoneyGram

Later, a delegation of MoneyGram, headed by its CEO and Chairman William Alexander Holmes, called on the Prime Minister at PM Office.

Finance Adviser Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh and Commerce Adviser Abdul Razak Dawood were also attended the meeting.

MoneyGram International Inc. is a globally recognized American money transfer company, which is offering its services at approximately 350,000 agent locations in more than 200 countries. It is facilitating overseas Pakistanis, with its 7,000 partners across the country to send their remittances back home.

Welcoming the interest evinced by MoneyGram International towards expanding its business in Pakistan, PM Khan highlighted significant growth in home remittances, witnessed during the last financial year that he said was expected to further grow in coming years.

The PM also discussed an incentive package, which was under consideration of the government, to attract greater remittances through legal channels.

While briefing Mr Khan about the company's profile and portfolio in Pakistan, William Alexander Holmes said MoneyGram, in line with the present government vision, was complementing its efforts towards financial inclusion especially encouraging emigrants to utilize formal channels for safe and speedy transactions.

The prime minister assured the delegation that his government would provide all possible facilitation to the company in expanding its business in the country.

Chinese delegation

President of China-Pakistan Friendship Association and former Under Secretary General of the United Nations Ambassador Sha Zukang also called on Prime Minister Khan.

Ambassador Sha is leading a delegation of major Chinese companies visiting Pakistan to explore Pakistan's business potential and to invest in the country.

The prime minister while welcoming the delegation to Pakistan underscored the closeness and depth of Pakistan-China ties.

Calling CPEC as a transformational project, Mr Khan invited the Chinese companies and investors to invest in diverse sectors in Pakistan.

The PM said the CPEC, a flagship project of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, would not only reinforce Pakistan's economic development but would also contribute to regional prosperity. 'Its second phase will focus on industrialisation, agriculture and socio-economic development,' he added.

Ambassador Sha underscored that Pakistan and China were all-weather strategic cooperative partners and their partnership was aimed at promoting peace, development and prosperity in the region. He said the special relationship between the two countries was reflected in expression of warmth by the Chinese people towards Pakistan on every occasion.

He said Chinese investors were confident about Pakistan's economic potential and expressed the hope that the economic relationship between the countries would reach the level of their excellent political relations.

Ambassador Sha's delegation includes companies related to real estate, construction, engineering, textile, IT and industrial sectors.

The delegates who visited Peshawar on Monday are also scheduled to visit Lahore, Karachi and Gwadar during which they will meet leading bankers, industrialists, entrepreneurs, financial experts, business chambers, and senior officials to deepen its insights and understanding of the economic opportunities in Pakistan.

CPEC and localisation

THIS refers to the issue of non-localisation of joint ventures by the authorities. While we should appreciate the government's efforts towards stabilising the economy and attracting foreign investment, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and other joint ventures must be more localised if they are have to benefit Pakistan.

CPEC forms an important part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. However, most CPEC projects do not directly contribute towards industrial output and export capacity of Pakistan.

To illustrate my point, I briefly present an example case of the Chinese Railroad Company (CRRC) operating in Turkey as CRRC-MNG Turkey and contributing towards real growth in Turkish society owing to localisation of the venture.

Located in Turkey's capital Ankara, CRRC-MNG Rail System Vehicles Industry and Trade Co., LTD, is jointly established by CRRC ZELC China and MNG Group Turkey, and has developed Ankara metro since November 2014.

Currently, its products are operated on multiple subway lines in downtown Ankara. CRRC-MNG employees (mostly Turkish) are trained to assemble rail vehicles in a major boost to Turkish localisation efforts. CRRC-MNG adopts the five localisations, including localised procurement, localised manufacturing, localised employment, localised marketing and localised management.

The company's Turkish employees account for over 85 per cent of the workforce, who are governed according to Turkish labour laws. A large percentage of parts are manufactured and procured locally, as per Turkish legislation for joint ventures. As a result of this wisely managed project, Turkey is developing at grassroots level.

A far better approach would be to enact laws which require Chinese companies to utilise 80pc of project resources (labour, management, engineers, materials, sub-parts, etc) from within Pakistan. Pakistan needs local legislation to help protect and develop our industry, labour and professionals. We need to put in place a 'localisation policy', just like few neighbouring countries are doing.

If CPEC projects are not 'localised' to involve active contribution by Pakistanis, we will never be able to take over these projects in coming decades and will always be dependent upon foreign/Chinese help.


 
 

Sino-Russian ties

IN a world of changing alliance patterns, it is obvious that China and Russia must come closer, the signing of Monday's gas deal between the two giants being just a small indication of the shape of things to come. While President Vladimir Putin called the 3,000-kilometre-long gas pipeline project 'historic', President Xi Jinping said that Sino-Russian relations were entering 'a new era'. The gas deal is an indication of the booming trade - which is estimated to reach $200bn by 2024 - between the two countries, and is in sharp contrast to China's declining economic ties with the US, the two having slapped tariffs worth billions of dollars on imports on each other. This is in addition to apprehensions on the larger geopolitical canvas. Washington is hostile to China's One Belt One Road project, and Beijing feels concerned over Washington's moves to create an anti-China alliance in the Pacific.

 More important, America seems determined to slow down if not block China's emergence as a world power. As for Russia, the end of the Cold War has not led to an idyllic peace with the West.

The 70th anniversary of Nato's founding finds the US-led alliance in a mess, with President Donald Trump calling France's Nato strategy 'brain dead'. French President Emmanuel Macron has his own grievances against Nato member Turkey and accuses Ankara of working with extremists in Syria by waging war on the Kurds, who he says are the West's allies against the militant Islamic State group. Turkey, which has purchased missiles from Russia, also opposes Nato moves to strengthen the Baltic states' security. The fissures within Nato are no solace for Russia, which is aware of Western anger over its Crimean misadventure. On Tuesday, Gen Mark Milley, American military chief, said China and Russia, and not Muslim militants, posed a threat to America. With Cold War loyalties cracking, and the focus of the world's economic and geopolitical power shifting towards the East, both Moscow and Beijing feel it is in their interest to come closer.


 
 

The Chinese version

TENSIONS between China and the US have escalated after the House of Representative's Uighur Human Rights Policy Act, 2019. The move is of a piece with the allegations of many international media and human rights organisations that China is persecuting the Uighur community and violating their rights - allegations that Beijing has denied. Calling the US action a political move aimed at damaging its international image, China says it is running a deradicalisation programme to mainstream its communities.

Read: Amid global outcry, China defends internment camps of minorities in Xinjiang

The Chinese claim has not been verified by independent sources and mystery shrouds its deradicalisation or re-education programme. China needs to demonstrate to the international community that it has inserted human rights safeguards in its deradicalisation measures.

On their part, the Chinese say that they are countering violent extremism (CVE) with a strategy that has been designed after a careful examination of CVE approaches in the West and in the Muslim world which also employ deradicalisation programmes. The Chinese view has been challenged by those who point out that standard global CVE practices are different from those espoused by China, and that global CVE practices are mostly conceived when countering terrorism perspectives.

Secondly, the Chinese definition of extremism is complicated as it hardly differentiates between religious, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural grievances. Nor does this definition describe separately the different sociopolitical manifestations of extremism, of both the violent and nonviolent variety. The Chinese deradicalisation programme is also a massive exercise in the sociocultural engineering of its minority communities.

China's communist party states that 'harmony' is the core driver of state policies as exemplified in its Belt and Road Initiative vision. The idea of 'harmony' or 'harmonisation' could have been conceived as a substitute for the regular democratic process, but has, instead, become a driver of legislative and administrative reform, including 're-education' strategies. However, China is still striving to generate a framework for 'harmonising' its ethnic and religious communities. Chinese scholars believe that adopting a muscular approach to 'harmonising' minority communities is the fastest way to make the autonomous and administrative regions trouble-free.

Uighur Muslims complain they are paying a huge cost for this 'harmonisation process', which is causing them to lose their religious, ethnic, and cultural identities. They find only a few voices being raised in their support in the Muslim world. The Muslim leadership, which is greatly concerned by Islamophobia, has apparently shut its eyes to the Uighur issue. Their silence is rewarded with Chinese economic assistance and diplomatic support on international forums.

Though Chinese authorities believe they will be able to achieve their envisioned sociocultural transformation, they are nervous about their global image. This year, China opened one 're-education' centre for international visitors in Kashgar, inviting diplomats, academics and journalists to visit it, in an attempt to counter international perceptions. But so far, such attempts have not impressed foreign visitors. While the centre seemed different from the images that appeared in the international media, the well-articulated responses of the trainees there created doubts in the minds of visitors. Secondly, Chinese authorities do not provide the exact number of deradicalisation centres, but according to the international media, at least 85 such centres have been set up in parts of the country, mainly in the Xinjiang region.

One component of China's counter-extremism framework is to challenge radical narratives, which is resulting in attempts to forge a new ethnic and cultural identity for Xinjiang's Uighur community. They are reinterpreting the history of Xinjiang and Muslims in China. According to some books and booklets, provided by the authorities to visitors, Chinese historians and scholars are making efforts to convey to their Muslim populations that they have been a part of the Chinese civilisation for thousands of years. Their emphasis on cultural integration is part of a multi-layered strategy.

A booklet titled Historical Matters Concerning Xinjiang and published by the State Council Information Office in 2019 rejects the idea that Xinjiang has ever been referred to as 'East Turkestan'; saying that there has never been any state with this name. According to the booklet provided by the state authorities, at the turn of the 20th century, terms such as 'pan-Turkism' and 'pan-Islamism' 'made inroads in Xinjiang' and 'separatists in and outside China politicised the geographical concept and manipulated its meaning, inciting all ethnic [Muslim] groups speaking Turkic languages ... to join in creating the theocratic state of East Turkestan'.

Chinese language courses are compulsory for Muslims because of communication barriers with Uighur and other Muslim communities, according to the Chinese authorities. An unusual aspect of this exercise is that the authorities are attempting to introduce a local, Chinese version of Islam on the pattern of its previous exercise of nurturing socialism with Chinese characteristics. For this purpose, Beijing has established Islamic learning centres to prepare imams, or prayer leaders, who can preach the 'Chinese version' of Islam. The curriculum of Islamic centres includes Chinese language, history, constitution, law, and culture apart from religious knowledge. These centres are not allowed to collaborate with other Islamic institutions in Muslim countries.

At a centre in Urumqi, the principal argued that religious institutions in Muslim countries focus on religious education and are divided along sectarian lines, but that the centres in China had adopted the values of socialism and developed compatibility between religion, patriotism and social cohesion. The principal told a group of international writers, including this writer, that 'Chinese Islam has no space for the evils like extremism and separatism'.

The Chinese authorities complain that Uighur Muslims are not law-abiding citizens. A booklet titled Vocational Education and Training in Xinjiang, published by the State Council Information Office, provides insights into the Chinese view of the issue when it claims that extremist forces act in accordance with 'fabricated religious law' and 'domestic discipline', and defy the country's constitution and laws.

It is interesting that at a time when exclusionism, supremacism, and hyper-nationalism tendencies are globally on the rise, China has decided to launch its own version of 'harmonising' society. This thinking might appear to negate the global trends but in essence, its objectives are similar, and it has little space for accepting diversity.


 
 

Bureaucratic hurdles making it difficult to import assistive devices

Even after the World Health Assembly passed a resolution moved by Pakistan to improve access to assistive technology, organisations working to address issues facing differently-abled Pakistanis say that bureaucratic hurdles are creating further obstacles for people seeking to obtain such devices.

The WHO unanimously passed a resolution last year to improve access to assistive technology for the differently-abled , elderly and those with non-communicable diseases, making it mandatory for all 194 countries to implement the resolution within three years.

The resolution was moved by Pakistan and claimed that one billion people need assistive technology and as the global population ages and the prevalence of non-communicable diseases rises, this figure will increase to more than two billion by 2050.

Assistive technology enables and promotes the inclusion, participation and engagement of people with disabilities, ageing populations and people with co-morbidities in the family, community and all parts of the society including political, economic and social spheres, it said.

But disability rights organisations in Pakistan have said that the government's conditions for documents such as a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Commerce for an individual to import assistive aids, in a country where few such products are manufactured, are creating more problems for citizens.

According to Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) Director General Dr Asad Hafeez, a policy is being made in consultation with the Ministry of Human Rights to address issues facing differently-abled Pakistanis.

Assistive devices and technologies are those whose primary purpose is to maintain or improve an individual's functioning and independence to facilitate participation and enhance overall well-being. They can also help prevent impairments and secondary health conditions.

Examples of assistive devices and technologies include wheelchairs, prostheses, hearings aids, visual aids and specialised computer software and hardware that increase mobility, hearing, vision or communication capacities. Currently, it is estimated that in low-income and middle-income countries, only 5 to 15pc of people who require assistive devices and technologies have access to them.

World Health Organisation Technical Adviser Dr Maryam Mallick told Dawn that according to a WHO estimate, 90pc of people with disabilities, people suffering from non-communicable diseases and elderly people in countries around the 'Belt and Road' need assistive technology and rehabilitation services to maintain and improve functioning and independence.

'Majority of these people in need currently do not have access to any kind of assistive products. Meeting this unmet need is definitely a challenge but at the same time, it is an opportunity for entering in a big new emerging market and changing lives of millions of vulnerable people. This in turn will contribute in stability, human security, peace and GDP growth,' she said.

There are two aspects to this issue, the head of the Potohar Mental Health Association Zulqarnain Asghar, said.

'First of all, the government has not taken even simple steps to address these issues,' he said. He gave the example of the government websites, explaining that only the first page of government websites can be accessed by visually impaired people using screen readers.

'Things will worsen in the future, as ministries are going to launch websites and correspondence in Urdu on directions from the Supreme Court and there is no script reader that can read Urdu,' he added.

Mr Asghar added that the requirement for a CNIC to import duty-free assistive aids has also been replaced with a mandatory NOC from the Ministry of Commerce. He remarked that an NOC is even needed to import a Braille embosser, an impact device that create tactile dots on heavy paper to make written documents accessible to the visually impaired.

'Even white canes are not manufactured in Pakistan. There was an effort to manufacture white canes in the past but their quality was very poor, so imports started again. The quality of wheelchairs is also very poor, and poor quality wheelchairs need to be banned in Pakistan,' he said.

Dr Hafeez from the ministry said that following the WHO resolution the government has taken a number of steps to provide assistive aids to those who need them.

'We have included all people with disabilities in the Prime Minister's Health Insurance Scheme, due to which they will be able to get free treatment and assistive aids. We have also signed a memorandum of understanding with China that will ensure the transfer of technology and under which China will increase the production of assistive aids so they can be provided to Pakistan,' he said.

Speakers at a seminar on Tuesday said though investments in agriculture are becoming riskier, especially for small farmers, these are key to ensure productivity and food security with the altering climate.

'Today we need to act. We need to accelerate and amplify our interventions and find ways to better support Pakistan and smallest farmers to increase their resilience to climate change,' said International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) Country Director for Pakistan and Asia Pacific, Hubert Boirard.

He believed that this year had brought extreme weather to every corner of the world.

'Our best chance of adapting to these rapidly changing conditions is through investing in smallholder farmers. It is important to equip them with the skills and resources needed to minimise the impact of agriculture on the environment,' said Mr Boirard.

Lessons should be learnt from China's technological advancement for smallholder farmers, MNA Sher Ali Arbab says

The one-day seminar provided an opportunity for development experts from IFAD, China and Pakistan to share innovative solutions, experiences and knowledge on how to develop resilient and high-value cropping systems.

They shared proven technical solutions to combat desertification and other related technologies that could be applied to the local context.

Climate-resilient and sustainable reforestation practices to support Pakistan's national development were the focus of the seminar, convened by IFAD and the governments of China and Pakistan.

In Pakistan, high levels of agricultural production and the continuously increasing population placed huge demands on the country's water resources. Lack of rain and other climate-related trends have further stressed the agriculture sector, said the participants.

IFAD representatives shared their experience in developing strategies and policies that contributed to sustainable rural poverty reduction and supported smallholder farmers in rural communities to mitigate the effects of climate change.

Chinese experts spoke on expertise in climate-resilient agriculture and reforestation and afforestation techniques, its interest in promoting knowledge sharing through South-South and Triangular Cooperation. The ideas shared were particularly in context of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Belt and Road Initiative collaboration with Pakistan.

'There are lessons to be learnt from China's technological advancement for smallholder farmers. Pakistan is interested in adopting agricultural technologies that will enable them to farm sustainably,' said Chairman Parliamentary Committee on CPEC, Sher Ali Arbab, MNA.

He expressed the hope that agriculture cooperation between the two nations would help grow their relationship and give opportunities to both countries for strong investment and joint ventures.Since 1979, IFAD has implemented 27 projects in Pakistan costing $2.8 billion, benefiting more than 17 million people.

PML-N Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed has said at a seminar on Saturday the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was not all about roads and other developmental projects but to strengthen ties between the two countries. He said the CPEC was a project of 'One Belt, One Road Initiative' involving more than 170 countries.

Due to the CPEC, Mr Syed, who is also chairman of Pakistan-China Institute, said 75,000 individuals in Pakistan had got jobs and $20 billion investment was being made. He said China sided Pakistan at that time, when no one was ready to invest in Pakistan, and made investments in Pakistan. He said the Pakistan-China Institute had so far organised eight seminars in various cities across the country.

Governor Chaudhry Sarwar said those hatching conspiracies in relations between Pakistan and China would never succeed as both countries had rock solid friendship. He said China sided with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue and at all forums, including FATF. He said Pakistan Army's sacrifices in the war against terrorism were unprecedented in the world. He said the Kashmir issue must be resolved in accordance with the United Nations resolutions to restore regional peace.

He said Pakistan and China had historic relations and the CPEC project was a big example of friendship as this project was ensuring development of Pakistan as well as creating vast employment opportunities. Under the CPEC, he said, some 1,544 kilometers long roads had so far been constructed, while 1,456 kilometers roads were under construction. He said 5,320 megawatts of electricity had also been added to the system. Under the CPEC, he said, nine special economic zones had been established and both countries also signed the CPEC Phase-II.

Chinese Consul General Long Dingbin said Pakistan was China's best friend and would move ahead shoulder-to-shoulder with Pakistan. Under the CPEC, he said, historic economic development and employment opportunities created in Pakistan in the last six years. He said Chinese companies had paid $300 million as tax in Pakistan and provided jobs to thousands of Pakistanis.

A district court exonerated on Thursday three Chinese nationals in cases pertaining to cyber terrorism, unauthorised data access and ATM-skimming fraud as the prosecution failed to prove the charges against them.

The foreigners - Xu Zhuping, Zhang Qiaocheng and Zhong Shaowen - were acquitted of the charges of committing electronic crimes, fraud and forgery in 2018.

District and Sessions Judge (south) Amjad Ali Bohio pronounced his verdict reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides. All the three men were produced in court from the prison.

The judge wrote in his order that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against the accused persons and acquitted them by extending the benefit of the doubt.

Investigation officer admits he did not conduct fair probe and submitted a false charge sheet against the accused

The judge also directed the prison authorities to release them forthwith, if their custody was not required in any other case.

According to the prosecution, Zhang Qiaocheng and Zhong Shaowen were allegedly spotted in suspicious conditions around an ATM installed at an HBL branch on Abdullah Haroon Road for two days.

On Jan 10, 2018 FIA officials captured them at 8.15pm while trying to insert a skimming device into the said ATM by committing unauthorised access to the critical infrastructure information system with the intention to cause damage to the public property, it added.

In August, the court had indicted them for committing an offence punishable under Section 13 (electronic forgery) of the Prevention of Electronic Crime Act (PECA), 2016 read with Section 420 (cheating or dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Complainant Munawar Ali, manager at the bank's branch, deposed that on a lead provided by the held accused, FIA officials also recovered 102 blank debit/credit cards, a union pay card, a 16 gigabytes memory card from their room in a guesthouse in Khayaban-i-Tanzeem, Defence Housing Authority. The investigators also recovered a magnetic strip reader (MSR) writer, other equipment and passports, he added.

The prosecution claimed that both the accused used the equipment to counterfeit the ATM cards/credit cards with dishonest intentions for unauthorised access to the information system or data to unauthorisedly copy or transmit the data, thus committing an offence punishable under sections 3 (unauthorised access to information system or data), 4 (unauthorised copying or transmission of data) of the PECA, 2016. The accused 'also committed the offences of cyber terrorism and cheating to deceive any person punishable under sections 5 (interference with information system or data), 6 (unauthorised access to critical infrastructure information system or data), 7 (unauthorised copying or transmission of critical infrastructure data), 10(a) (cyber terrorism) and 14 (unauthorised use of identity information) of the PECA, 2016', the prosecution added.

The complainant, Munawar Ali, further deposed that he lodged a complaint stating that over Rs10 million had been stolen from 559 of its customers' accounts through bogus ATMs, credit and debit cards by the accused persons. The transactions had been traced to Indonesia, China and other countries, he added.

The witness testified that upon noticing suspicious activities of the foreign nationals, he sent two staffers - Salman Haider and the relations manager - to inquire about both men, who then tried to escape but the shopkeepers caught hold of them.

The complainant added that an ATM-skimming device and a spy camera were allegedly recovered from their possession. Both the suspects had arrived in Pakistan on Jan 2, 2018 on business visas.

The investigating officer, Sub-inspector Bilal Ahmed, filed an interim charge sheet against both the accused along with a forensic laboratory examination report, which concluded that the memory cards and the magnetic strip reader writer were being used for preparation and utilisation of the counterfeit ATM cards/credit cards.

However, the judge pointed out that none of the two staffers and shopkeepers were cited as witnesses by the investigating officer, adding that without evidence of the material witnesses the charge would become unfounded unless proved by corroborative evidence.

The judge noted that the prosecution also failed to produce the CCTV footages showing the accused roaming around and installing the skimming device in the ATM machine, as the IO deposed that the bank did not provide him information about the amount withdrawn from the bank by committing fraud through alleged devices.

The IO's admission

The IO admitted that he did not do fair investigation and submitted a false charge sheet against the accused.

The investigator also admitted that he failed to collect the video recording shown to the accused, who after seeing the same had admitted their presence at the ATM machine, adding that in fact there was a CCTV camera recording of the bank, which he did not collect as evidence. The investigator also admitted to have failed to collect the fingerprints of the accused persons from the place of the occurrence of the alleged offence during investigation.

The judge noted that the prosecution neither examined witnesses - staffer Salman Haider and the relation manager - nor it collected CCTV footages, which could have been the best evidence to prove their presence and doing something with the ATM machine, was withheld by the prosecution without any plausible reason or justification.

The prosecutor pleaded to the court to convict the accused persons since they themselves had filed an application pleading guilty under Section 265-E of the criminal procedure code.

However, the judge said that the same applications were dismissed on July 3 after hearing arguments from the parties, but the prosecution failed to challenge the order so far. The judge further pointed out that the prosecution failed to cite as witnesses the employees of the guesthouse in whose presence the alleged recoveries were made from the room of the accused.

He also mentioned that the prosecution did not examine a single bank account holder, who was deprived of the amount lying in the bank of the complainant, adding that even the complainant and bank authorities failed to show withdrawal of any sort of money through ATM card within a couple of days of the alleged incident.

Denial of allegations

Earlier, in their statements, under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, both the detained Chinese nationals denied the allegations.

Their defence counsel, Ahmed Khoso, contended that the prosecution witnesses were officials of the bank and the FIA, whose evidence could not be relied upon without corroboration of the independent witnesses to convict his clients.

The counsel further contended that there was a violation of Section 103 of the CrPC, as the alleged recoveries were shown in the media during a press conference while unsealed property was sent to the chemical analyser after an inordinate delay, which created doubts in the prosecution's case.

He added that there was no proper complaint filed in the present case in compliance of Section 31 of the CrPC, thus pleaded to acquit the accused.

However, FIA prosecutor Zakir Hussian argued that the prosecution witnesses fully implicated and connected the present accused persons with the commissioning of the offence and proved the charge against them beyond a shadow of a doubt. Thus, he pleaded to the court to punish the accused persons in accordance with the law.

The judge also acquitted a third Chinese national, Xu Zhuping in an identical case of skimming an ATM machine of the Muslim Commercial Bank branch in Adamjee Nagar, Tipu Sultan.

The judge noted that the prosecution case hinged upon two points: first that the accused was arrested by head-constable Babar Ali and alleged recovery of articles (skimming devices, etc) and Rs650,000 withdrawn by using forged ATM cards by managing the bank consumer data of the ATM account-holders without their consent/knowledge was made from the accused persons.

The court ruled out the confession allegedly made by both the accused before the police could not be relied upon to convict him since neither any interpreter was appointed by the FIA officials nor did the accused understand Urdu or English.

The judge ruled that during cross-examination FIA investigating officer Sub-inspector Hamid Wali admitted that no letter was issued to him by the FIA assistant director to conduct an inquiry into the present case and obtain custody of the relevant record and case property - including Rs60,000, passport, ID card of the accused, 11 ATM cards, a USB, a brown and a red card, a handbag, card holder and 1,784 yuans.

Secondly, the IO admitted that neither the word 'withdrawal of amount' nor 'forgery and fraud' were mentioned in the inquiry document, as alleged in the FIR. Not only this, but he also admitted that in the complaint it was not alleged that the present accused accessed the domain of the bank or he went into the ATM booth or tempered with it, the judge added.

IO Wali also admitted that no complaint was made by the MCB Bank Tipu Sultan branch that an amount from any account was fraudulently withdrawn or tempered with.

'Such admission prima facie suggests that since no complaint to the extent was made that, any fraudulent transaction was observed in the bank, therefore, prima facie from the evidence brought on record it appears that the IO has transgressed his authority and went beyond the mandate and formed opinion against the accused without incriminating evidence brought on the record,' the judge wrote.

He further ruled that the accused were arrested on Jan 14, 2018 at 06.30am by head-constable Babar Ali of the Bahadurabad police station and admittedly they were kept in custody for 35 hours without remand and subsequently handed over to the FIA authorities, whereby without cogent and corroborating piece of evidence, the case was challaned, whereby the accused faced agony of protracted trial being a Chinese national in custody, which leaves a bad impact on the process of investigation in our country.

The second prosecution witness, Mirza Kashif Iqbal, branch manager, deposed that from the CCTV footage he observed some fraudulent transactions were made, thus prepared a USB of the footage and submitted it to the FIA, but in an unsealed condition.

The manager deposed that the FIA head office asked him to go through the record and detect fraudulent transactions but no complaint was received from any customer regarding fraudulent transfer of money from their accounts.

The judge noted that the witness prima facie failed to point out any fraudulent transaction was made at any time from the ATM on one hand and, on the other hand, his entire evidence was silent on pointing out any fraudulent transaction made at any time by any accused or anybody else.

Another witness Kamran Mushir deposed that he went to the branch on Jan 14, 2018 and checked the ATM machine, but did not find any irregularity. The witness said that he also visited the ATM machine on Jan 15. He saw scroll and CCTV footages and found some transactions made in the early morning by the Chinese nationals, but they were not successful.

The judge ruled that it meant no successful transaction was made as per his evidence and in cross-examination his admission to the extent that as per the CCTV camera recording the accused remained inside the ATM booth for 56 seconds and as per the footage the accused did not temper with the ATM machine or any other equipment.


 
 

CPEC moving into high gear

THE inauguration of the 300-megawatt Gwadar coal-fired power plant in November was the first major sign in a long time, signifying that the multibillion-dollar China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative was back on line.

The plant's launch was preceded by the 9th Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting that had signalled renewed eagerness of both Beijing and Islamabad to reboot the project, which had otherwise been on a slowdown since early 2017.

The formation of the controversial CPEC Authority and the appointment of a retired general as its head, a decision some allege has effectively shifted the CPEC's stewardship from civilians to the military, are also being seen in the same context. There is also a general expectation that the bilateral cooperation around the corridor initiative is going to get a new push in 2020, as it enters the second phase of its development and its focus shifts to the country's troubled areas, especially in Balochistan.

With the military now in full control of the corridor initiative, Beijing's influence on how the Imran Khan government, which didn't appear much bullish on the project in the beginning, handles CPEC schemes in the future has also grown.

The two sides have also agreed to start or escalate work on different new or stalled transport and energy schemes, including the $9.2 billion railway line (ML-I) to upgrade the track from Peshawar to Karachi, the construction of highways for completing eastern and western corridor routes, securing borders with Afghanistan and Iran to protect CPEC projects, etc.

Both sides used the last JCC to broaden the scope of future collaboration around CPEC to industrial and agricultural development, copper/gold mining, oil and gas exploration, affordable housing, social sector, and poverty alleviation, moving away from the large energy and transport infrastructure schemes undertaken in the first phase.

Officials related to CPEC projects hope that the government would provide a new impetus to the project in 2020. Asad Umar, who was given charge of the planning and development ministry on Chinese insistence on his return to the cabinet, couldn't be reached for comment. However, he recently said that the benefits of CPEC would start to trickle down to productive sectors of the economy, including industry and agriculture in 2020.

The second phase of the CPEC development would build on the success of the early harvest projects that had helped remove energy and road bottlenecks and focus towards generating greater economic activity and job creation, Mr Umar said. 'The second phase focuses on industrialisation, socio-economic development, agriculture modernisation, and tourism promotion. Central to the second phase is the development of three special economic zones (SEZs) - Rashakai, Allama Iqbal Industrial City and Dhabeji - on a priority basis to attract large foreign direct investment and reverse the tide of deindustrialisation,' he added.

Hasan Daud Butt, the previous CPEC project director, expects the focus to shift towards upgrading the Peshawar-Karachi railway track, SEZs, fibre-optic connectivity and the development of Gwadar city in 2020, and hopes that the newly formed CPEC Authority (read military) is going to play a crucial role in the second phase of development.

But there are some who are not so optimistic, insisting that a combination of Pakistan's ongoing economic and financial troubles and an adverse American narrative about the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), of which CPEC is an important part, may likely hamper a faster movement on the corridor project in the near term.

'Growing American opposition to the BRI in the wake of ongoing tensions with China and Pakistan's financial issues could frustrate the plans to put CPEC on a fast track in 2020,' said an Islamabad-based development consultant, who refused to give his name because of personal reasons.

In support of his argument, he pointed out that the IMF's demand for greater scrutiny of the Chinese investments and loans along with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's warning in August 2018 that any 'potential IMF bailout for Pakistan should not provide funds to pay off Chinese lenders' were mainly responsible for the pause in the work on CPEC.

Others don't buy this argument. 'CPEC has pretty much been on a slowdown since late 2017, but it has been internal and bilateral economic and political dynamics that have been decisive rather than outside pressures,' Andrew Small, the author of The China-Pakistan Axis: Asia's New Geopolitics, told Dawn.

'The US stance is significant largely in the context of the battle for international opinion over BRI. Unlike during the previous phase, when the US was fairly neutrally or even positively disposed towards CPEC, there is now greater interest in pointing out flaws and failings in BRI's flagship initiative,' he said in reference to the remarks made last month by senior US diplomat Alice Wells.

But he does not expect the American stance to have much of an impact on the multibillion-dollar project. 'CPEC's fate will continue to be far more dependent on Pakistani and Chinese political choices and the economic dynamics in Pakistan; there will just be additional scrutiny and criticism of the whole thing coming from the US side,' he said.


 
 

'Pakistan should protect its national interest over Middle East crisis'

Speakers at a discussion on Monday warned that Pakistan should protect its national interests over the Middle East crisis, and the country's top priority should be economic security.

The talk titled 'Changing Regional Security and Implications on US-Pakistan Relations' was organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).

Speakers were of the view that Pakistan must be mindful of its economic security which is the country's top national interest and be careful taking sides or staying neutral in the current conflict between Iran and the US.

Research professor at the Naval Postgraduate School Department of National Security Affairs in Monterey, California Prof Feroz Hassan Khan said that given the precarious economic situation, unfortunately, Pakistan is not sovereign enough to make any independent decision to take sides or to stay neutral in the recent conflict between Iran and the US.

'Pakistan's top national security issue and challenge is its economic security, without which the country would not be able to modernise its national security which is imperative for survival. Pakistan's dependency on the [International Monetary Fund] programme, aid and financial assistance from Saudi Arabia, and [Financial Action Task Force] conditions are negatively affecting the country on the foreign policy front,' he said.

'The fraught situation in the Middle East is the ultimate test of Pakistan's diplomacy,' Mr Khan added.

He urged the country to keep certain priorities, including continuing efforts in the Afghan peace process, preventing conflict or war with India and remaining relevant in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by successfully implementing and completing the China Pakistan Economic Corridor projects.

He said those who support US President Donald Trump's decision to kill the Iranian commander argued that the Soleimani's assassination was an attempt by the US to re-establish deterrence to stop Iran from going beyond and crossing a red line.

He said there could be multiple reasons behind this killing including domestic politics in the US or Mr Trump's impeachment. Regional security and power dynamics are changing and redefining, to which Pakistan must be mindful, he said.

He foretold three possible scenarios regarding Iran's reaction: asymmetric warfare by Iran mainly using the Hezbollah card, a growing arms race in the region and thirdly, nuclear proliferation through Iran backing out of the nuclear deal.

'Anyone of these reactions would be a huge setback to international security, and certainly would have serious implications on Pakistan,' he said.

To a question on unilateralism by the US in the current Middle East crisis, Mr Khan said this is the era of strongmen who most of the time use power to suppress the opposition, which exactly what Mr Trump has done or Indian Prime

Minister Narendra Modi is doing in his own country and in India-held Kashmir.

To another question, he said Iran would remain in the Non-Proliferation Treaty as it has a limited capacity to conduct nuclear tests and continue to the path of its nuclear programme according to the treaty's provisions.

SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri said that while the situation in the Middle East is very concerning and worrisome, Pakistan has to be very careful this time while weighing its options over the current conflict between Iran and the US.

He said that Pakistan has to take care of its own interests first and try to play its role in de-escalating the situation to avert greater chaos in the region. Otherwise, in case of any further escalation or conflict, the whole region will pay a huge cost for decades to come.

Speakers at a ThinkFest session were unanimous that the so-called accountability, IMF package, mismanagement and poor law and order situation are the reasons for low investment and decline in export-led growth and unemployment.

They said the leading economists must come forward and gave a viable plan to the government for taking the country out of the debt-driven economy.

'I will list some of the reasons that are creating hurdles in the way of country's economic growth. These include poor law and order situation, so-called accountability and weak governance. In a situation where an officer of grade-17 silently works and retires in grade-22 without doing any extraordinary work and those who do hard work honestly are caught by the NAB, who will dare invest in our country,' deplored Miftah Ismail, former federal minister for finance, revenue and economic affairs.

He was speaking at the session titled 'Pakistan and its economy: why is it always muddling through?' here on Sunday.

The session was moderated by Savail Hussain and other panelists were economists Hafeez Pasha and Salman Shah.

Miftah Ismail, others spell out reasons for low investment

Mr Ismail said Pakistan was not competing with its neighbouring countries as India and Bangladesh have the growth rate of 7 and 6.5 per cent, respectively. Similarly, Sri Lanka too is ahead of Pakistan.

He said the law and order situation was better today than it was in 2013 but the foreign investors were still afraid of investing in Pakistan. Moreover, he said, getting visa for Pakistan from other countries was the most difficult task.

'Governance is another issue and we don't encourage the local government system. The officers who work honestly are caught on the pretext of accountability. Mismanagement also exist in the power sector as no one worked for exploring local natural gas. Our ceramics industry has almost collapsed owing to unavailability of gas. At present, we are importing tiles from China,' he said.

In order to bring the economy in the right direction, he said, we would have to understand the triangle and linkages of tax, growth and investment.

Hafeez Pasha recalled that the last regime (PML-N) initially faced problems but later it controlled the situation that increased our foreign reserves and helped reduce dollar exchange rate to Rs105.

'It happened after the government did massive borrowings in three years that caused a considerable growth in our imports and that further led to enhancing the current account deficit at a peak level in the financial year 2017-18,' he said.

He said Pakistan's economic story was based on money coming from abroad (remittances, loans, support funds etc). 'If the money continues coming, we have good days and if not, we see bad days,' M Pasha said.

He said the war on terror damaged the country's economy as it cost US $225 billion. But the country received only US $30 billion, he said.

BELT and ROAD: In another session titled 'Belt and Road: A Chinese World Order', the panelists were of the view that the member countries of China's Belt and Road initiative joined it voluntarily and not under any pressure.

'Sixty-five countries have become partner of China's project. And they have done this voluntarily,' Masood Khalid, former ambassador to China, said.

As for the CPEC, he said China didn't dictate anything to Pakistan keeping in view the time-tested relations between the two countries. 'There is a win-win situation for both countries over CPEC's execution,' he added.

FISCAL DEVOLUTION: A panel spoke at a session titled 'Will provinces bankrupt the centre: fiscal devolution post 18th amendment'.

Dr Ayesha Ghaus-Pasha said the 18th amendment didn't make the federal government economically weak. 'If we review this, we find that it has only caused a difference of 1.5 per cent in the share of the federation and nothing more,' she claimed.

However, Punjab Finance Minister Hashim Jawan Bakht, Minister for Revenue Hammad Azhar and KP Finance Minister Taimur Jhagra said there was a need to strengthen the federation first.

PRISON DIARIES: Miftah Ismail who remained in the jail and NAB custody for about six months, denied the allegations levelled against him, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and others over the LNG deal with Qatar and construction of an LNG terminal in Karachi.

'When I asked them to show me the LNG deal of any country that is made cheaper than Pakistan's, they couldn't do so. And when I asked to show me the cost of any terminal cheaper than the one we got constructed, they had no answer,' he deplored.

He criticised the government and the NAB for victimising the country's brains who contributed a lot.


 
 

Blacklisted firms got CPEC project contracts, says Wells

Senior US diplomat Alice Wells on Tuesday renewed criticism of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), impliedly urging Islamabad to rethink its involvement with it.

Amb Wells' speech at a think tank event, which was attended by members of academia and representatives of civil society, criticised the flagship project of China's One Belt One Road Initiative.

She alleged that there was no transparency in CPEC projects, claiming Pakistan's debt burden was growing due to the Chinese financing.

While her arguments looked like a repeat of the remarks she had earlier delivered at the Wilson Centre in Washington on Nov 21, 2019, the claims were renewed during her Islamabad trip a few days after Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi sought closer engagement and a robust trade and investment relationship between Pakistan and the US.

FM Qureshi had also sought help from the US to get the country off the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list.

While reiterating the allegations against CPEC, Amb Wells said companies blacklisted by the World Bank had got contracts in the CPEC.

The US diplomat also questioned the immunity from prosecution for the newly formed CPEC Autho­rity that served as the focal body working to identify new areas of cooperation and projects, besides facilitation, coordination and monitoring of ongoing projects.

About the debt problem, Amb Wells insisted that Chinese money was not assistance. By getting Chinese financing for the projects, Pakistan was buying expensive loans and as a buyer it needed to be aware of what it was doing as this would take a heavy toll on its already struggling economy, she contended.

The diplomat also touched on the cost escalation in railways ML-1 upgrade project. The link connects Karachi with Peshawar. She urged the government to be transparent about the mega project.

A Foreign Office statement, meanwhile, said US Acting Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells met Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood.

The agenda of the meeting largely comprised bilateral issues including the prospects of intensifying political engagement and expanding economic partnership. 'It was emphasised that a strong trade and investment relationship was key to advancing the shared vision of the leadership of both countries for a long term, broad-based and enduring partnership,' the statement said.

While talking about human rights abuses by Indian troops in the occupied Kashmir and Delhi's aggressive actions against Pakistan, including intensified LoC ceasefire violations, Mr Mahmood emphasised the need for international community to play its role for ending the rights violations and peaceful resolution of the dispute.

About peace and stability in Afghanistan, the foreign secretary reaffirmed Pakistan's resolve to continue to support the peace process and pursue positive development in Pak-Afghan relations. Pakistan also remained committed to supporting the efforts for de-escalation of tensions and promoting the prospects of a diplomatic way forward on the differences and disputes in the Middle East, he said.

In a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Nadeem Babar at the energy ministry office, Amb Wells said the US was ready to enhance cooperation with Pakistan in the energy sector especially in the renewable energy. Mr Babar proposed cooperation in tapping Pakistan's Shale reserves, specialised training, investments in LNG infrastructure development, renewable energy and other avenues.


 
 

Imran rejects CPEC's criticism as 'nonsense'

Prime Minister Imran Khan has rejected the criticism of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as 'nonsense,' insisting that the project 'is really helping' the country.

In an interview to a US news channel CNBC, shown on Wednesday night, Mr Khan also urged US President Donald Trump and the United Nations to mediate between Pakistan and India over Kashmir.

'When the Chinese came to help us with this Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and CPEC, we were really at the rock bottom,' said the prime minister when the interviewer, Hadley Gamble, asked if the project was a debt-trap for Pakistan.

'So, we are really grateful to the Chinese that they came and rescued us,' he added.

'They came and pumped in, not just they gave us loans - and the loans, by the way are barely five or six percent of the total portfolio,' said Mr Khan, rejecting the suggestion that the CPEC was a debt-trap. 'This is nonsense.'

Terms Kashmir far more serious a problem than people realise

The Chinese, he said, actually helped Pakistan with investment and because of them the country now 'has an opportunity to attract foreign investment'.

The prime minister explained that his government was now creating special economic zones to attract investment. 'We just opened two and we are opening more where we are giving special concessions to industries,' he said.

Mr Khan said the CPEC was 'beyond BRI as China was also helping Pakistan in technology transfer. They are especially helping us in agriculture because Chinese technology (can boost) development (in this sector) much better than Pakistan's as 'our productivity is very low'.

The CPEC, he said, was also teaching Pakistanis the skills they needed to benefit from the CPEC projects. 'They are building skill centers in Pakistan. So, they are helping us and we are grateful,' the prime minister said.

Earlier this week, senior US diplomat Alice Wells once again urged Pakistan to rethink its wholeheartedly embrace of China's economic initiative. Speaking at a think-tank in Islamabad, she alleged that there was no transparency in the CPEC projects, and warned that the country's debt burden was growing due to the Chinese financing.

Both Chinese and Pakistani officials have rejected the US criticism as misleading but the prime minister's remarks further cemented the impression that Islamabad remains committed to the CPEC.

The prime minister spoke with CNBC in Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the annual summit conference of the World Economic Forum.

When the interviewer asked how useful could the US president be in settling the Kashmir dispute, Mr Khan said: 'I can't say what would be the outcome but for me it is important to try my best because Kashmir is a far more serious problem than people realise.'

'This is serious because there are two nuclear-armed countries,' the prime minister said. 'That's why I want President Trump, head of the most powerful country in the world - he should intervene right now. United Nations, or President Trump through the UN at least.'

Mr Khan explained that the possibility of an India-Pakistan conflict had increased because 'India has been taken over by an extremist ideology, which is called Hindutva or the RSS.'

The prime minister said that the founding fathers of RSS were 'inspired by the Nazis' and the Nazi concept of 'racial purity' and 'believed in ethnic cleansing, of Muslims.'

Mr Khan said that the ideology which was responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi and the group that was declared a terrorist organisation three times by previous Indian governments had now taken over India.

Responding to another question, he said the people of Kashmir, through a referendum could decide whichever country they wanted to join.

'Now, that disputed territory has been annexed by India, and, they are trying to change the demography of (the) people of Kashmir, which according to the fourth Geneva Convention is a war crime,' he added.

The prime minister also expressed concern about ongoing protests in India over a controversial citizenship bill passed last December that many say is set to disproportionately affect Muslims.


 
 

Alice's (mis)adventures

IF stirring controversies is part of the present-day diplomat's job, then it sits somewhere on top of Alice Wells' job description at the US Department of State. Since Pakistan shrugged off the concerns she voiced about CPEC from Washington, the diplomat left the comforts of her home to travel to the Pakistani capital with more revelations.

Unsurprisingly, the ensuing debate earned her no accolades but scathing criticism from Beijing and Islamabad. Besides, it left many Pakistanis - including this writer, who considers CPEC as an economic opportunity for the country - wondering if they could distil this diplomatic hubbub for some valuable insights.

Ambassador Wells charged CPEC in November 2019 with poor commercial viability and lack of transparency. She claimed Pakistan owed '$15bn debt to Beijing and $6.7bn to Chinese commercial banks'.

Is the Beijing-Washington spat over CPEC a welcome development for the common Pakistani?

A day after, the minister for planning, Asad Umar, disputed those figures by disclosing that the public debt to China stood at $18bn. Of that, $4.9bn relates to CPEC projects and the rest was borrowed from the Chinese government and commercial banks to stabilise forex reserves and finance trade deficit.

A few weeks later, the Chinese embassy in Islam­abad in a rebuttal to Wells' claims stated that Beijing had provided $5.9bn of concessional loans, booked as public debt, for CPEC's transportation projects. Ad­­d­i­­tionally, Chinese companies and their partners in­­vested $12.8 in the energy sector and are themselves responsible for their ventures' commercial viability.

Who will dispute that numbers don't lie, but they are utterly deceptive when cherry-picked - and that's how this exchange appears to have unfolded in some aspects. Regardless, the public statements of Umar and the Chinese embassy suggest that the amount owed to the Chinese government, commercial banks and investors combined is nearly $30bn. The breakdown: concessional loans of $6bn for public infrastructure projects; $13bn of public debt borrowed from the Chinese government and banks; and about $11bn of equity and commercial loans for CPEC's power project. The volume may grow in the coming years. For instance, the ML-I project to upgrade the railway between Karachi and Peshawar at an estimated cost of $8.2bn alone will have a major impact.

Before we Pakistanis heed Wells' advice and pose 'tough questions' to our government and China, there are tougher questions that demand necessary soul-searching for Washington and an explanation to the American public. For example, despite allocating tens of billions of tax dollars in economic assistance to Pakistan, why has the State Department failed perpetually to earn widespread goodwill in the country? Pakistanis are eager for Washington to come clean on its patronising and strengthening of unelected regimes in their country and undermining their nation-building exercise endlessly. And when, if ever, will it abandon its local cronies who are the principal beneficiaries of the so-called 'development aid'?

On part of the Chinese embassy, its willingness to disclose financing details of CPEC projects is commendable, but most of that information is already in the public domain. For being in its sixth year, it's most appropriate for CPEC to yield the outcomes that can dispel critique of it effectively. Its success is crucial for the Chinese leadership who'd wish to showcase it as a success story of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to become a trusted partner for the Global South. On the contrary, critics may argue that if Beijing cannot nurture a mutually beneficial partnership with its purported 'iron brother' what well-being can it promise to others?

Some matters require Beijing's immediate attention to end doubts about CPEC's economic viability for Pakistan. For instance, it's a norm for the Pakistani government to issue sovereign guarantees to independent power producers to mitigate high country risk. The advent of Chinese funding set a new, costly precedent. In addition to sovereign guarantee, Chinese banks required IPPs to buy an insurance cover from China's state-owned insurance company, Sinosure.

For every dollar owed in principal and interest, IPPs pay an insurance premium of 7pc to Sinosure, which is prohibitively high. It's no secret that these commercial banks are owned by the state who de­­f­i­nes their lending practices and priorities too. One wishes for these banks to have placed faith in Pak­istan's sovereign guarantee as put by international lenders, which would result in savings of tens of billions of rupees for the local ratepayer. A corrective measure in this regard will reinforce Beijing's commitment to the well-being of the Pakistani public.

For Pakistan, this debate, or spat, has strategic and economic implications. Firstly, we need to understand the context of Wells' rhetorical critique. The US policy of vilifying China's economic diplomacy endeavour, the BRI, is well known. For being a major pillar of the BRI, CPEC will naturally attract Ame­rican criticism. And Pakistan's fragile economy and its decades-long dependence on American handouts make it the cheapest punching bag for Washington. Islamabad must realise that it doesn't belong in the boxing ring among two global heavyweights and should refrain from reacting irresponsibly.

Secondly, our government must stop being a desperate borrower and be transparent in its financial dealings. For instance, we were told that Pakistan borrowed $13bn from the Chinese government and commercial banks but were not given sufficient information about the lending terms. Has it ever occurred to our decision-makers that such murky practices may undermine the reputation of our allies such as China? Moreover, whomsoever we invite to fund public infrastructure they will demand their risk be priced adequately. But what led the PML-N government to offer unprecedented incentives for power projects under CPEC, which prompted doubts about the transparency and competitiveness of this strategically important endeavour?

To sum up, whatever the price tag, $60bn or $600bn, for CPEC to vindicate President Xi's pledge of promoting inclusivity and mutual prosperity through the BRI, the time is ripe for CPEC to outgrow the mould of diplomatic cajoling and transform itself into an enduring venture of economic cooperation. It's fair to expect that Beijing won't shy away from taking measures to ensure that CPEC starts benefiting common Pakistanis sooner than later.


 
 

CPEC: The ball is in Pakistan's court

China asserts that it is not wavering from its commitment to assist Pakistan in the second, people-centric phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Despite being embroiled in multiple problems - the virus epidemic, growth moderation and trade spat with the United States - the Asian dragon is all set to commit $1 billion in the current calendar year to kick-start the next phase of CPEC.

In an exclusive interaction with Dawn, China's Consul General in Karachi Li Bijian was open and clear about the mutual relationship and its future. He dismissed the perception that China is disillusioned by the Pakistani leadership and has adopted a wait-and-see strategy before committing support for CPEC's second phase.

'This is a figment of some naïve elements' imagination. Nothing can be far from the truth. I can confirm that China has helped Pakistan close physical infrastructure gaps in the first phase and wishes to see benefits of this massive investment flowing to Pakistani youth, farmers, labour and disadvantaged segments in the second phase,' he asserted.

He declined to comment on a possible US role in peddling doubts about CPEC and its cost.

'We can't order private investment. We know well it will not be persuasion but the profit expectation and risk coverage that will mobilise them,' CG Li

The second phase of CPEC is focused on public and private collaboration in industrial, agriculture and social sectors (poverty alleviation, training and research to transform industrial/agriculture sectors to improve productivity and competitiveness). The specifics of commitments for the identified projects have yet to be finalised, but about $1bn is expected to land in the country over the next 11 months.

Read: CPEC 2.0: The promise and peril

In the first phase, the thrust was on bridging the physical infrastructure deficit (electricity, logistics and the port). Big-ticket projects close to $21bn in energy, transport infrastructure and Gwadar Port are either complete or about to finish shortly.

Expanding on his argument, the consul general stated: 'The relationship between the two countries is not transactional. We are long-term partners who share the common dream for a just and inclusive order that affords decent living standards for all citizens. China chose Pakistan to be the first stop for its One Belt, One Road vision.'

'If there was some confusion in the party that assumed power after the 2018 general elections, it has been cleared. We know the current leadership in Pakistan understands and acknowledges CPEC's value for the country and its future,' he added, putting to rest the perception of deliberate reluctance on either side.

He also mentioned the revised China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has added 301 items to the list of articles enjoying duty-free access to the gigantic Chinese market. 'It can translate into $6bn worth of additional export from Pakistan to China if the potential of the facility is properly leveraged,' Mr Li elaborated.

To a question regarding little interest among private Chinese companies in relocating their operations in Pakistan, the consul general was not apologetic. He attributed it to a lack of suitable business environment that had de-motivated even local investors.

'We can't order private investment. Yes, we are encouraging companies. We know well that it will not be persuasion but the profit expectation and risk coverage that will mobilise them. We are engaging with the relevant quarters in Pakistan to work out an incentives package for Chinese investors in special economic zones (SEZs).'

About $1bn is expected to land in Pakistan over the next 11 months as part of the second phase of CPEC

Elaborating on multiple factors that influence the decision of Chinese companies about the destination of their overseas investment, he mentioned the low quality of workforce in Pakistan. 'Finding workers with required skills was identified as a big challenge by prospective Chinese investors. We intend to initiate more skill training programmes for workers in Pakistan to ensure the availability of employable youth for Chinese companies setting up shop here. Currently, we are setting up one such facility at Gwadar.'

Commenting on the current slump in Chinese funding, the consul general mentioned multiple challenges that his home country is facing. 'Taking care of I.4bn- strong population is not a mean challenge in itself, especially when the GDP growth rate has moderated to 6.1 per cent from over 8pc annual average. The global slowdown and trade frictions with the United States are there. The fear of a virus epidemic in a country of high population density has soaked up the government attention. In this environment, China can't afford to be too generous. Like others, we also need to justify to our people the resources diverted to other countries.'

He said the next Joint Coordination Committee meeting is still on the agenda. 'The tradition of top-level exchange of visits will be maintained this year. Such frequent bilateral visits will further promote and strengthen the existing relations and cooperation.'

Experts involved in CPEC-related affairs agree that sometimes China raises issues, but it would be wrong to interpret those as second thoughts on Pakistan. 'The problem is on Pakistan's side. The PTI leadership took long to absorb the value of Chinese support to the economy that is on a slippery slope. All members of the leading team might still not be fully convinced by the official line to make CPEC fly. This, however, has proven to be insufficient.

'The Khan government is still struggling to put in place a workable mechanism acceptable to all federating units for implementing the second phase of CPEC,' a well-connected source in Islamabad commented.

Several attempts to reach retired Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa, chairman of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority (CPECA), for his input did not succeed.

Zafar Hasan, federal secretary for planning , was upbeat about the future of CPEC. He confirmed that the incentives package for local and Chinese investors in SEZs was in the works in collaboration with Chinese counterparts.

He defended the newly established autonomous authority that he said would be sufficiently empowered and made financially independent to coordinate and streamline dealings with all relevant departments and ministries and lower tiers of the government in CPEC-related projects across Pakistan.

As for the past and present inflow of funds from China, Mr Hasan said working out the exact quantum was a little difficult and involved monetising goods and services associated with CPEC projects. He did not confirm or dismiss the projection of $1bn worth of support in 2020 mentioned by the Chinese consul general.

'The intent might be there but the pace of progress is woefully slow. It is almost criminal. The government must immediately remove irritants delaying the arrival of Chinese investment that might ease economic stress through job creation or the strengthening of social protection programmes,' commented a senior officer anonymously.



 

Future lies in export-led growth strategy: PM's aide

Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce, Industry and Investment Abdul Razak Dawood said on Tuesday that the government's export-led growth strategy had started bearing fruit as Pakistan had posted a 13.6 per cent growth in exports at a time when regional competitors were witnessing a decline.

Speaking at the 'Dialogue on Industrial Cooperation under CPEC and SEZs Framework - on CPEC Phase II' organised by the Board of Investment (BoI), Mr Dawood elaborated on the framework of economic development strategy and stated that Pakistan's future lay in export-led growth, which made the development of special economic zones (SEZs) vital to improve the capacity and complement the export requirements of the country.

Pakistan's economy faced a lot of challenges in terms of fiscal and current account deficits and required serious steps in terms of devaluation, control on imports and government expenditures, he said.

Explaining the objective of SEZs under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the adviser said the SEZs were open for businesspeople from all countries, as incentives under SEZs were the same for everyone.

He claimed that investments in various sectors had started pouring in and the pace would pick up in the coming days.

Mr Dawood said that the second phase of CPEC was about industrial and agricultural cooperation, while the next phase would be about connectivity with regional and global markets, as a part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The adviser appreciated the efforts of exporters and businessmen for achieving this result and expressed his gratitude to China for the second phase of the Free Trade Agreement which, he said, was poised to further boost the growth in overall exports of Pakistan.

Earlier, BoI Secretary Omer Rasul stated that the dialogue would help BoI in fulfilling the objectives and setting a tone for policy-making in future. Mr Rasul explained to all that important findings and insights from the session would be presented to the forums concerned of the government for consideration and approval.

Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing, who co-chaired the dialogue, stated in a press release that the second phase of CPEC was about the engagement of the private sector, local community and society at large while underlining that the current phase of CPEC would cover industrial cooperation, agriculture cooperation, social cooperation, poverty alleviation and cooperation in science and technology, with an aim to boost the economy of Pakistan as well as to raise the skill set and living standards of the local population.

Initiated in 2013 by the Chinese government, the BRI seeks to build a modern version of the Silk Road to link China with the rest of Asia, Europe and beyond. The CPEC, under which Beijing has pledged billions of dollars for infrastructure in Pakistan, is central to the BRI.


 
 

Financing human development

WITH over two million people infected, Covid-19 has gone exponentially viral across the globe. No one really knows how the impact of the pandemic will play out on the economic, social and power dynamics.

In addition to the ongoing human tragedy, there lies a long recessionary phase leading to bankruptcies, massive job losses, rising poverty and continued uncertainties for quite some time.

Serious questions are already being raised on the current practices of capital controllers, effectiveness of democracies and vulnerabilities of healthcare systems. One thing is certain that there will be a huge pressure on resource mobilisation for rebuilding states, revival of businesses, job creation and building social safety nets.

This rather grim and testing time, unprecedented in recent history, poses a huge challenge to the old school leadership that has facilitated elite capture of resources for populist interventions, leaving very little space for human development.

The potential impact of this global outbreak is expected to be particularly severe on fragile states and conflict zones. The United Nations secretary general has rightly appealed to warring nations for an immediate ceasefire to focus on humanitarian efforts and to open precious windows of diplomacy.

The unparalleled devastation wrought by the pandemic is a rude reminder to all those countries which have neglected social sector investments, particularly in health and education, and have disproportionately diverted fiscal resources towards unproductive infrastructure, defence contracts and other crony capital deals.

Pakistan's ranking on the UNDP's Human Development Index (HDI) stood last year at 152 out of 189 countries - 13 per cent below the average HDI of South Asia, including Bangladesh and India. India is ranked 129.

It is time for the nation to start confronting their rulers about the negligible allocations for health. The country spends only 1.12pc of GDP on health - way below the minimum required average of 4pc.

With a large youth population, it is high time to reflect upon scenarios of national security and economic sustainability with such a meagre resource allocation for healthcare. It will be prudent to start reprioritisation of public policies to deal with vulnerabilities of human security.

The key challenge is how to influence thinking in historically rigid public policy structures protected by patronage, populism and elite capture.

Looking at the development spending patterns through the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) of the federal government and the Annual Development Plans (ADP) of provinces, it is obvious that majority of the funding goes to infrastructure projects without any serious analysis or coordination.

Social sector spending remains almost invisible in the overall fiscal pie. This year's development budget of Rs1.6 trillion is already lower than those of recent years and utilisation capacity is likely to further erode due to diversion of attention towards Covid-19 response.

While wastage of public sector expenditures is colossal, we have never tried to explore innovative ways of financing health and education. The current crisis provides an opportunity to develop a consensus about spending priorities and stop pouring more into a leaky bucket.

Biggest asset

It is crucial at the moment for nations to take a firm stance on the need to prioritise human development and focus on quality of life. Pakistan's biggest asset could be a healthy and skilled workforce to get us out of a prolonged recession.

The coronavirus pandemic will turn global economic growth 'sharply negative' this year, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. The world is faced with the worst economic crisis since the 1930s Great Depression.

So how will developing countries raise financing for tackling poverty, revival of jobs and for strengthening human security in the coming years when tax revenues and global trade are expected to plunge. The answer is complex and only out of the box solutions, coupled with visionary policy shifts, may lead us towards accomplishing this goal.

Our leadership is currently focused on debt relief, charitable contributions for cash transfers to the poor and some monetary incentives for selective economic sectors like the construction industry. Given the looming economic crisis over the next two years, Pakistan needs to look for new ways of financing its policy options to revive the economy and to preserve jobs. Getting immediate debt relief will be cumbersome, but debt rescheduling is very much on the cards.

Our domestic debt is three times higher and expensive than the international debt and economic managers should strike a deal with banks for slashing down interest rate as well as the option for delayed repayments.

China has emerged as a winner by defeating this pandemic through its unparalleled commitment, resources and discipline. As part of the strategic and economic objectives of Belt and Road Initiative, China must extend substantial long-term financial support to Pakistan to strengthen its health and labour force infrastructure.

The two governments should urgently start a dialogue on human capital development under the CPEC framework. At the same time, size of the federal government needs to be cut down, privatisation of assets should be prioritised and money for infrastructure should be raised through domestic financial markets rather than overburdening the shrinking tax base.

All this could happen only if the state invites top professionals to volunteer in this difficult time.

At the diplomatic level, both India and Pakistan should seriously think about bringing down the heat of conflict so as to create more fiscal space. A responsible public policy and diplomatic response from India and Pakistan will be welcomed by the people of South Asia and the world at large.

With expected pressures on fiscal space due to both demand and supply side compression, loss of lives and livelihood, it is time for opinion makers in South Asia to reshape the discourse of dialogue towards human security and reduction of conflict.

Such a response will only be possible if consistent evidence-based messages go out from think tanks, international financial institutions, media and private sector leaders.

High-risk countries approach  China  for debt relief

Following in the footsteps of Pakistan, many high-risk countries who are part of the ambitious Belt and Road Initia­tive (BRI) have approached China for debt relief, the Financial Times reported.

Last month, Pakistan requested China for ease in payment obligations of over $30 billion of about 12,000-megawatt power projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC) to minimise its financial and economic difficulties, the newspaper reported. This was part of government efforts to sec­ure discounts and savings on power purchases from independent power producers (IPPs) as circular debt liabilities cross Rs2 trillion.

Early this week, the Eco­nomic Coordination Commi­ttee (ECC) of the cabinet authorised the Economic Affairs Ministry to negotiate debt relief with 11 bilateral lenders, including China, under a G20 initiative to suspend for about a year the payment of debt and its interest. Pakistan has to pay about $615 million to China between May 2020 and June 2021 under bilateral debt. The Chinese ambassador to Pakistan has since held a couple of meetings with Economic Affairs Minister Khusro Bakhtiar and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Dr Hafeez Shaikh.

Pakistan had formally taken up its difficulties with China for relief in purchase prices at the highest level during the recent visit of President Arif Alvi to Beijing, as Pakistan's capacity payments alone were estimated to be closer to Rs600bn this year, and estimated to go beyond Rs1.5 trillion in a few years.

Pakistan has requested two basic relaxations in the existing agreements given the emerging challenges amid economic meltdown across the world in the wake of Covid-19. First, Pakistan desires to bring down mark-up on debt to London Interbank Offer Rate plus two (Libor+2) per cent from the existing average of about Libor+4.5pc.

Second, Pakistan has sought an extension in debt repayment period in the tariff to 20 years from the existing repayment period of 10 years. Almost all the power sector projects in the country have upfront 10-year debt repayment in their tariff structure. The two discounts are estimated to save about $500-550m (more than Rs85bn) annual cash outflows.

'China has received a wave of applications for debt relief from crisis-hit countries included in the 'Belt and Road Initiative' as coronavirus strains the world's biggest development programme,' reported FT quoting Chinese policy advisers, adding that Bei­jing was considering a number of responses, including the suspension of interest payments on loans from the country's financial institutions. But they also warned against expectations that China would forgive debts outright.

As the world moves through extraordinary times, the future will not look the same as it did just a few months ago. It is hard to predict what will be altered forever and where people will just fall back on old practices, but signs indicate that future infrastructure demand will certainly change. It will be crucial to meet these demands with a focus on sustainability rather than following the habits of the past.

This was stated by Kate Newman, vice president of sustainable infrastructure at the World Wide Fund (WWF) for Nature-US, at a virtual workshop titled 'Sustainable Infrastructure and Greening the Belt and Road Initiative', organised by the WWF-Pakistan and the network's Governance Practice.

The workshop aims to review and launch WWF's global Sustainable Infrastructure Strategic Framework, with a focus on energy, maritime and industrial infrastructures.

The online event was joined by experts from more than 30 countries, including China, Brazil, Germany, Myanmar, Kenya, the US and UK, and Pakistan.

In his address of welcome, Malik Amin Aslam, adviser to the prime minister on climate change, said infrastructure was the backbone of sustainable development for Pakistan.

'We are making our energy, water, transport and even the building systems sustainable, which will help shape the future of our citizens. The government is taking every possible effort to increase forest cover and promote alternative energy solutions to meet our energy needs.' The government was optimising the use of nature-based infrastructure that would help conserve biodiversity and critical ecosystems in the country.

In his keynote speech, Dr Adil Najam, dean of Pardee School of International Affairs, Boston University, stressed on the importance of sustainability in the post Covid-19 reconstruction and said infrastructure should not be just a term, but all infrastructures should be sustainable and green.

Hammad Naqi Khan, director general of the WWF-P, explained that the objective of the workshop was to ensure that infrastructure services were in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

He emphasised that with the threat of climate change, a shift towards sustainable infrastructure was required.

WWF-China CEO Sze Ping Lo shared his views on Greening the Belt and Road Initiative in Covid-19 context.

US praises Pakistan's cooperation for peace in Afghanistan

The Tru­mp administration's outgoing point person for South and Central Asia Alice Wells on Wednesday praised Pak­istan for 'solid cooperation' for peace in Afghan­istan and emphasised that future of bilateral ties depended on Islamabad's continued support.

'We have seen over the last year, solid cooperation between Amb Khalilzad and the Pakistani civilian and military leadership to encourage the Taliban to take steps to reach the negotiating table,' Ambassador Wells said during an online media briefing in which she reviewed and reflected on US policies in the region during the past three years.

Amb Wells, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs at the State Department, is retiring this month. This was possibly her last official media engagement.

'The advancement and improvement and the foundation for a stronger US-Pakistan partnership is premised on our ability to work together constructively to advance peace,' she underscored.

Recalling how the United States upped the pressure on Pakistan to deliver on its counter-terrorism expectations, the retiring senior diplomat said President Trump's strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia unequivocally made it clear to Pakistan that it needed to take 'decisive action' against groups, and the subsequent suspension of security assistance demonstrated Washington's 'resolve'.

'Since then we have seen constructive steps by Pakistan to encourage the Taliban to advance the Afghan peace process. Pakistan has also taken initial steps towards curtailing terrorist groups that threaten the region, such as arresting and prosecuting the LeT leader Hafiz Saeed and beginning to dismantle terrorist financing structures,' she further said.

Amb Wells said that the US-Pakistan ties, especially bilateral trade, expanded as Islamabad's commitment to peace in the region grew.

She said continuing violence in Afghanistan was at an 'unacceptable level'.

Noting that progress to intra-Afghan political negotiations in the peace process had been difficult, she said it was the responsibility of the Taliban to reduce violence.

Amb Wells urged the Afghan government and the Taliban to jointly fight Covid-19 and ISIS-Khorasan that has carried out numerous 'ruthless and evil attacks' including last week's attack on a maternity centre in Kabul in which mothers and newborns were killed.

The peace process, she reminded, was difficult, but obstacles have to be overcome.

The US diplomat said India's role in Afghanistan was crucial. The importance Washington attached to India with regards to its Afghan policy, she said, was evident from Amb Khalilzad continuing consultations with Indian leaders on the issue.

'Obviously, it's up to India to determine how best to support the peace process. India is a very important actor in Afghanistan, $3 billion in assistance that has already been pledged, touched every province, the diplomatic and political support that India traditionally has provided to Afghans. … India's going to be a critical player and is a critical player,' she said.

CHINA: Amb Wells repeated her criticism of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its flagship project China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and urged Beijing to relieve the countries involved in these undertakings of its 'predatory loans'.

She said the US calls on 'China to offer transparent relief from the BRI's predatory loans that countries are suffering from, emerge on stable footing.'

Amb Wells reiterated the US was concerned about CPEC projects because of lack of transparency, and the unfair rates of profits that are guaranteed to Chinese firms involved in their execution.

The Fore­ign Office (FO) on Friday said that China-Pakistan Econo­mic Corridor (CPEC) was transparently contributing to national development and issues in the execution of the project were bilaterally addressed by Beijing and Islamabad through existing mechanisms.

The statement was issued after senior US diplomat for South and Central Asia Amb­assador Alice Wells rep­eated her criticism of China's Belt and Road Ini­tiative (BRI) and its flagship CPEC project. The FO statement, however, did not say that it was a rejoinder to what Amb Wells said at her online media briefing about CPEC.

'The economic development and long-term prosperity of the people is our government's top priority. The CPEC, a flagship project of BRI, is a transformational project contributing positively and transparently to Pakistan's national development,' the FO said.

'Pakistan believes that regional economic connectivity will provide a critical stimulus for creating broad-based growth across the region,' it added.

The FO said that CPEC projects had helped Pakis­tan address energy shortages and develop infrastructure, industrial base and create jobs.

At her media briefing, Amb Wells said that the US was concerned about CPEC projects because of 'lack of transparency', and the 'unfair rates' of profits guaranteed to the Chinese firms that were executing these projects.

She said the US calls on 'China to offer transparent relief from BRI's predatory loans that countries are suffering from to emerge on stable footing'.

The FO clarified that Pakistan's total public debt relating to CPEC projects was less than 10 per cent of the total debt burden. More­over, it said, the CPEC loans from China had a maturity period of 20 years and the interest was 2.34pc. There­fore, the claims about the bur­den of Chinese debt on Pak­istan's economy were 'con­trary to facts', the FO said.

The statement said that Pakistan and China had instituted various mechanisms to address issues that arise in the execution of the projects and they often address those matters bilaterally.

'Pakistan and China are 'All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partners'. We are engaged in prompting peace, development and stability in the region based on principles of mutual respect, mutual benefit, win-win cooperation and shared development,' the statement emphasised.

'Our ties are based on deep mutual trust and understanding,' it further said.


 
 

Navigating an unsettled world

IN an unsettled world where strategic tensions between big powers are mounting, Pakistan faces daunting foreign policy challenges in a turbulent global and regional environment. The pandemic has injected greater volatility into an international landscape already afflicted by threats to multilateralism, trade and technology wars between big powers and attempts by regional powers to reshape the rules of the game in their neighbourhood.

Understanding the dynamics of a world in disarray where unilateral actions and rejection of international norms by big powers and populist leaders hold sway is important as they have implications for the pursuit of Pakistan's foreign policy.

Four key policy areas pose immediate challenges and have to be simultaneously addressed: 1) Navigating the US-China confrontation 2) Dealing with occupied Kashmir and managing relations with an implacably hostile India 3) Helping Afghanistan win the peace but also preparing for less hopeful scenarios 4) Balancing relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Rising tensions between the US and China have a direct bearing on Pakistan. Even as Islamabad does not want this stand-off to affect its relations with either of the two countries, that is easier said than done. What has been described as a new cold war will intensify in a US election year when President Donald Trump has made China-bashing a central plank of his re-election campaign. He is both playing off a bipartisan political consensus and fortifying anti-China public sentiment that preceded the pandemic and has been strengthened by it.

Pakistan faces daunting foreign policy challenges in a turbulent environment.

The pandemic has also reinforced US plans to reduce economic dependence on China by reconfiguring or diversifying global supply chains and pursuing a more overt contain-China policy. When this gets underway it may result in India emerging as a stronger economic partner of Washington. This will also bolster the longer-standing American strategy to project India as a strategic counterweight to China especially as India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems willing to play that role.

The implications for Pakistan of the US-India entente are already evident by Washington's tepid response on Kashmir and continuing augmentation of India's military and strategic capabilities. Thus, closer US-India relations will confront Pakistan with a regional environment of greater strategic imbalance.

Concern about CPEC and China's Belt and Road Initiative has prompted frequent US criticism of these megaprojects. A White House report sent last month to Congress is more explicit, asserting that BRI will give China 'undue political influence and military access'. Statements by American officials that CPEC will impose a heavy debt burden on Islamabad represent unsubtle though vain efforts to drive a wedge between Pakistan and China. While Islamabad will want to avoid getting in the cross hairs of US-China friction it is obvious that Pakistan's strategic future lies with China. CPEC is emblematic of China's aim to strengthen Pakistan, economically and strategically, and must be our overriding priority.

Pakistan's relations with China remain on a positive trajectory but will need regular reinforcement. Close consultation with Beijing on key global and regional issues, including Afghanistan, will be important.

Ties with the US have improved, but lack substantive content. For now, the main commonality is Afghanistan. That too will be tested in coming months when hurdles are encountered in the fragile Afghan peace process. Nevertheless, it is important to keep engagement on a positive track while accepting the limits of the relationship.

On Afghanistan, Pakistan should extend whatever assistance it can to the much-delayed peace process, still facing a host of challenges. The recent Eid ceasefire between the Taliban and Kabul and the accord between President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah have however brightened prospects. What Pakistan's establishment must come to terms with is President Trump's intention to pull out US troops regardless of whether intra-Afghan talks advance or produce a negotiated end to the war. The latest indications of this are the US military withdrawal proceeding ahead of schedule and Trump's reiteration that it was time for Afghans 'to police their own country'. Washington's stance is unlikely to change if Trump loses the November election to Joe Biden as they have similar views on disentangling the US from its costly involvement in Afghanistan.

Islamabad thus needs to think long term and prepare for different scenarios that might emerge in Afghanistan keeping in view machinations by regional countries acting as spoilers in Afghanistan's peace effort.

Pakistan's most imposing challenge however will remain managing relations with India where the Modi government is bent upon crushing the Kashmiri resistance by unprecedented levels of repression and orchestrating anti-Muslim sentiment and pogroms in India. Dialogue with Delhi is ruled out by its brutal and illegal actions in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, where even medical services have been denied during the pandemic, and India's refusal to discuss the issue. Aggressive moves by India on the Line of Control and covert actions in Balochistan represent a toxic mix that have sent tensions soaring with Pakistan. Prime Minister Imran Khan's repeated warnings about a possible false flag Indian operation underlines the growing danger.

Faced with this, Pakistan will have to avoid any engagement for the sake of engagement with India unless Pakistan's concerns are accommodated in future talks. This is hard to see under Modi.

On Kashmir, Pakistan needs a strategic approach and a sustained diplomatic campaign - not an on-off approach. Tweets are not a diplomatic strategy. Noise is not a policy. A strategy for a changed global environment should preserve our principled stance while mobilising international support for a peaceful Kashmir settlement. This means pushing the boundaries at the international level. For a start, a virtual meeting of OIC foreign ministers should be sought, taking advantage of the rising concern among many OIC countries about India's anti-Muslim actions. Once the situation permits, Pakistan should also seek a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council exclusively on occupied Kashmir to refocus world attention on the egregious human rights violations there.

Space limits detailed consideration of policy towards the Middle East. Most importantly, Pakistan should deftly balance its relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who remain locked in a tense stand-off, and stay the course on a policy that avoids being drawn into their rivalry, however challenging it may be given Pakistan's increased financial reliance on Riyadh.


 
 

As Bob Marley's 'Buffalo Soldier'

BETWEEN 1840 and 1940, way before Bob Marley would sing Buffalo Soldier in a searing lament to the black men from Africa shipped as slaves to fight Native Americans for their white masters, a similar drama was enacted in Asia.

In China, Indian soldiers and policemen - mostly Sikhs and Pathans - were hounding the Chinese people for the British, to peddle opium and to claim political power for their colonial masters. China lost and ceded Hong Kong in an enforced lease to Britain until 1997. The Chinese call it a century of humiliation. Indian soldiers and policemen participated in the conquest of the Chinese, not unlike the black men who were used to subjugate the native people in North America.

'Buffalo Soldier' was the term used by Native Americans for African men inducted in the mid-19th century to all-black cavalry and infantry regiments created by the US Congress. 'Stolen from Africa/ Brought to America/ Fighting on arrival/ Fighting for survival.' Thus sang Bob Marley, urging fellow African Americans to never forget their history, a history George Floyd may been killed for embracing recently.

There's little culturally or remotely Indian about tea, though Modi's followers may not want to see the point.

Narendra Modi, like many men obsessed with the unprepossessing framework of nationhood, has a library of ready and garbled ideas about what is Indian and what isn't. He won elections claiming his origins as a tea vendor, neither realising nor revealing that tea, and certainly tea laced with milk that he once sold, came through colonialism to India from China. As such, there's little culturally or remotely Indian about tea, though Modi's followers may not want to see the point. What is truly and originally Indian is cotton, which was first grown in the Harappan Valley, and its Indian farmers are committing suicide.

The colonial transaction of tea and opium put an economic and political burden on the Indian people. The Americans grasped the perfidy more readily. They dumped boxes of British-labelled tea into the sea, and called it the 'Great Boston Tea Party', thereby proclaiming independence from Britain.

While we are on the subject, even Pakistanis may wish to figure out what their forebears were drinking, as religiously as they celebrate tea today with such fuss and ritual, had the British not raided China. Nineteenth-century Urdu poets provided some hint of what they were sipping, but tea was not it.

Before the British or the Mughals arrived, India was celebrated in China, Central Asia and in the farthest regions of East Asia for its unique cultural export called Buddhism. In the Southeast Asian region, the cultural conquest came as a mix of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It's a tribute to the durability of this peaceful transaction that devout Muslim men and women bearing Hindu names in Southeast Asian countries routinely stage the story of Ramayana with aesthetic appeal and reverence. Before the advent of colonial gunboats to ply politics and culture, Buddhism was ferried to Korea by sea, this time by a Buddhist princess from Ayodhya, as India's Pranab Mukherjee was reminded during an official visit to Seoul. A Buddhist, not a Hindu, princess from Ayodhya!

I once visited the White Horse Temple in Louyang, the revered Chinese cultural hub. This Buddhist shrine in landlocked Henan was where the monks first travelled from India, at least one of them on a white steed, around 68 AD. One witnessed P.V. Narasimha Rao, the inveterate Brahmin, standing in obeisance before the Buddhist shrine before flying to Beijing to sign the landmark treaty of peace and tranquillity. It is this 27-year-old pact between Rao and Li Peng that is being tested in the tense military stand-off underway along the borders in the Ladakh and Sikkim regions. There are two memories at work here, and a couple of political and economic expediencies.

The Chinese question the Indian view on the boundary as a legacy of India's colonial historiography. Indian officials encourage the memory of 1962 to fester, when, they believe, China betrayed India's trust by waging a border war. There's an archive full of compelling literature on both sides about who poked who in the eye to set off the extended round of bad blood. Suffice it to say that the Chinese also had a seven-month-long bloody stand-off with Moscow at about the same time, including the so-called Ussuri River incident.

Had the memory of that Sino-Russian rift been allowed to linger, there would perhaps be no Shanghai Cooperation Organisation of which India and Pakistan are currently full members. Had the memory of 1947 been allowed to overwhelm the present and the future, similarly, there would be no Sikhs offering food and solidarity to Muslims at protests against a new citizenship law.

It is curious that while memories of 1962 are officially fanned, few would recall that Richard Nixon, Donald Trump's inspiration, had dispatched the nuclear-armed Seventh Fleet into the Bay of Bengal to threaten India. Why is it that in the course of a discussion on keeping Indian Ocean sea-lanes secure from Chinese dominance, Indians desist from remembering they once opposed American bases in Diego Garcia?

Several explanations have been offered for the Sino-Indian stand-off. They range from securing the Gilgit-Baltistan route for CPEC, to American sale of anti-submarine helicopters to India ostensibly with an eye on China.

However, on March 17, 2017, the UN Security Council passed a resolution on Afghanistan. The 34th paragraph welcomed and urged 'further efforts to strengthen the process of regional economic cooperation … including through regional development initiatives such as the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road [the Belt and Road] Initiative….' It would be clearly wiser for India to leverage China on the belt and road initiative to deal with its problems with Pakistan. While Pakistan has played the Buffalo Soldier in the Zia era, India could yet learn from its neighbour's humbling experience. As for China, it might consider rewarding India with a bit more than a tea habit.


 
 

Pakistan needs to go beyond tree planting to thrive after Covid-19

The economic recovery from Covid-19 needs to be green. The devil, though, is in the details: policies that offer the best returns for government spending while moving us closer to reaching net-zero emissions need to consider income and gender inequality.

A study published in May by the University of Oxford found that investing in projects which simultaneously aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while boosting economic growth deliver high returns on government spending in both the short and long-term. There is also evidence that such projects can create 'shovel-ready' jobs that are compliant with coronavirus-induced social-distancing requirements. Additionally, green stimulus packages help uphold national commitments to cut carbon emissions under the Paris Agreement.

A column published on World Bank Blogs states that governments need to consider a number of factors before rolling out green stimulus packages. The eventual common goal should be that no government, acting in haste to control an unprecedented crisis and dodge unavoidable criticism, initiates a project with attractive and marketable characteristics but no real backbone over the long term.

While many believe China is embracing a green recovery by planning construction projects that deliver a low-carbon economic stimulus, the country is simultaneously loosening restrictions on the construction of new coal-fired power plants. India and Bangladesh seem to have largely overlooked green stimulus packages in their Covid-19 recovery plans.

In comparison, there is progress and hope in Pakistan's 'Green Stimulus' package. It is aimed at "job creation and the restoration of our natural ecosystems", as Malik Amin Aslam Khan, Pakistan's chief climate change adviser, wrote recently for The Third Pole. The package is an extension of the existing Billion Tree Tsunami project. It is commendable that the green stimulus has already created a reported 65,000 jobs for daily wage workers and envisions employment for 600,000 more in the second phase, even though this is dependent on securing approximately USD 600-100 million through donor funds. It is especially creditable that the promised focus of job creation is on women and young people.

But there are questions about whether large-scale investment in planting trees is the best way to mitigate climate change; whether the effectiveness of trees as carbon sequesters (trees act as natural carbon sinks and absorb the carbon present in the atmosphere) has been considered and why alternative, or even supplementary, green projects to revive Pakistan's national economy haven't been given strong priority.

There is no doubt that tree plantations help ecosystems recover and provide a variety of benefits for wildlife and people. They protect mature natural forests from deforestation, encourage certain wildlife species, sequester atmospheric carbon warming and provide employment. Afforestation drives are green glue that bring together governments, civil society organisations and the beneficiaries.

However, human-planted forests need to be maintained for decades before their benefits as carbon sequesters and wildlife sanctuaries are realised. More often than not, they are cut down before then to clear land for farming. A study of regenerated forests in Costa Rica between 1947 and 2014 found that 50% were cleared within 20 years, while in Brazil and Peru they were cleared after only a few years. Many wildlife species also never really acclimatise to monoculture tree plantations and require mature tropical forests to thrive.

It is an additional obstacle for the success of Pakistan's 'Green Stimulus' package that a (now outdated) 2010 report by the National Environment Information System, referred to in a scathing Lahore High Court ruling, says that Pakistan has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, between 0.2% to 0.5% per annum.

It will not be possible to reap the long-term intended benefits of the green stimulus unless the existing deforestation rate is reduced, and forest restoration success vigilantly monitored through satellite and neutral local organisations on the ground.

Many factors affect whether trees serve as effective carbon sinks, including the species, their age, and the soil and topography in which they are planted. There are also concerns about the planting of non-native trees which can actually harm ecosystems, discourage local species from inhabiting the area and trigger wildfires.

Planting trees is therefore a welcome initiative, but can distract attention and redirect funds from other, more effective, measures that can mitigate climate change and generate jobs. Some examples of other green projects include investing in renewable energy infrastructure, expanding the availability and accessibility of broadband to encourage working from home, redesigning roads for cycling and building flood protection.

Pakistan can consider all of these options and more, such as expanding its renewable energy sources, subsidising solar energy installation and integrating renewables with electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure. This last option in particular should be a priority for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor - the Pakistani component of China's Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure projects. Our planet and trade practices need heavy-duty electric trucks more than they need coal power plants that are marketed as 'eco-friendly'.

The government can also use this moment to invest heavily in education to raise awareness and in training on eco-friendly agricultural practices. Currently, women in Pakistan are underrepresented in the technology and manufacturing sectors. Our green policies must be inclusive, and investment in R and D and training for women is an ideal starting point.

Climate goals were ignored in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when a desperate attempt to boost construction, mainly through the use of fossil fuel-powered steel and cement production, caused carbon emissions to rebound. This time our recovery must advance climate goals.

Almost every country in the world will need to rebuild their economic engines to kick-start their journeys out of recession. Recovering from the Covid-19 economic crunch should not push climate change to secondary status relative to economic recovery, or erase the decades of painfully cultivated sense of urgency around climate action.


 
 

Strategic shift?

WITH the geopolitical landscape of our region changing fast, many optimists say they are able to see a shift in Pakistan's geostrategic approach. Some believe this shift is largely oriented towards geo-economics, and if established, it would be a major doctrinal shift. But so far, state institutions have not hinted at that in their statements. Or perhaps, this is merely an issue of a different reading of their actions.

Pakistan's faltering economic indicators do not lend weight to such notions that the state is making some expedient efforts to strengthen its geostrategic or geo-economic approach. For one, even the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which was until recently projected as a game-changer for the country's weak economy, has become a victim of the short-sightedness of state institutions. However, those seeing a shift in Pakistan's geostrategic approach do not use economy-related arguments only; they also highlight the changing geopolitical behaviour of the state, specifically towards Afghanistan.

Pakistan's role in the Afghan peace process is vital. It was widely appreciated as being instrumental in sealing the US-Afghan Taliban deal of Feb 29. But this does not reflect any change in Pakistan's strategic approach. Instead, it supports its long-standing position; it has long been advocating that a negotiated settlement between the Taliban and other Afghan stakeholders is a viable solution for Afghanistan.

Pakistan has facilitated talks between the US and the Taliban because of several reasons. First, the US has acknowledged Pakistan's stance of negotiated settlement. Secondly, the Belt and Road Initiative and CPEC were also factors because China does not want a major, protracted conflict near a key belt of its ambitious connectivity initiative. Similarly, Pakistan's internal security concerns as well as its urge to correct its global image have proved to be critical reasons.

Pakistan's cooperation on Afghanistan has not generated support for its stance on India-held Kashmir.

It requires an in-depth inquiry to examine how effectively Pakistan used these factors and to what extent they have influenced the country. However, Pakistan's strategic doctrine appears to have remained unchanged in the process mainly because the geopolitical and strategic challenges facing the country have still not been resolved. Nevertheless, these challenges have become more complicated after India revoked the special status of India-held Kashmir last year on Aug 5, which was granted under Article 370 of the Indian constitution.

Pakistan tried hard to raise the issue before the international community and on the relevant platforms - especially focusing on human rights abuses in held Kashmir. These efforts yielded results, and international media and rights groups took the atrocities in Kashmir seriously. However, Pakistan has not cultivated enough political and diplomatic support to force India to review its brutal practices in Kashmir. China supported Pakistan's stance at the UN Security Council but that was not enough to pressurise India. However, a real setback was experienced when the Muslim bloc led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE obstructed all Pakistani efforts to use the Organisation of the Islamic Conference platform for Kashmir. It showed that the religious bond is relevant in international relations only when coupled with a strong economy. South Asia is the region Pakistan considers the least essential, or perhaps it does not fit in well with the state's ideological framework. Pakistan's close bilateral relations with South Asian nations would have generated political capital to pursue its geo-economic and political interests in the region.

Despite introducing structural and stabilisation reforms, Pakistan is desperately looking for economic revival. The power elites' continuing practices reflect that they are mainly capitalising on the strategic importance of the country, which they believe can perform miracles time and again by diverting international investment and aid towards Pakistan. The nuclear arsenal and strong military forces have contributed to this confidence. Afghanistan is central to this approach, from where the country can extract global support. Afghanistan is important for Pakistan not only in the context of the Indian presence in its backyard but also for strategic reasons, and the US has exploited it very well.

Pakistan's cooperation in the Afghan peace process facilitated the improvement of its global image, reduced the trust deficit in its relations with the US, and helped it get loans from international financial institutions. But Pakistan's cooperation on Afghanistan has not generated support for its stance on Kashmir. Second, in its efforts to balance its relationship with the US and China, Pakistan has significantly lost focus on CPEC, which was a rare opportunity for the revival and strengthening of its economy. However, Pakistan has not used the Afghanistan factor effectively. Some say the fear of being blacklisted by the FATF, the international financial watchdog, has forced it to extend more support to the US in Afghanistan. The FATF has proved a lethal factor, neutralising Pakistan's efforts to take advantage of its cooperation in Afghanistan.

Maintaining an equilibrium in its relationship with China and the US is another challenge for Pakistan. The country has a history of ups and downs in its relationship with the US, but it cannot afford a standstill with China, as the relationship has an altogether different nature in the geopolitical, geo-economic, and geostrategic contexts. The impression, which has developed during the last two years, that Pakistan is eager to restore its relationship with Washington has created resentment in Beijing. The slowdown of CPEC has strengthened suspicions.

In a nutshell, Pakistan is struggling to adjust its geopolitical priorities, and nothing substantive has changed in its geostrategic doctrine. A geostrategic shift should have manifested itself in better trade and political relations with neighbours and aggressive pursuit of implementation of transnational energy and infrastructure megaprojects, which have already been agreed upon and just need a little push. CPEC and its connectivity with Afghanistan, as well as structural economic reforms would have substantiated such a shift. All these efforts need-out-of-the-box thinking and courageous leadership.

Fixing the economy through a geostrategic lens cannot be called a doctrinal shift.


 
 

A perilous stand-off to avoid

IT was a pleasant day in October 1962. Barrister Ishtiaq Ahmed Abbasi was settling down for his sundowner when the watchman came charging in. 'Sir,' he was quaking with fear from the news on the radio. 'China has attacked Hindustan.' Unmoved by the intrusion into his quiet repast, Abbasi Sahib resolved the matter expeditiously. 'Dekho, phaatak band kar do.' (Look here. Just shut the gate.)

Abbasi Sahib lived in a sprawling mansion across the road from the British-era governor's palace in Lucknow. His wife, the celebrated thumri singer and movie actor Begum Akhtar, concealed her emotions, a trick she had learnt while performing for difficult patrons, primarily the royal courts of Jaipur and Hyderabad.

It was the masthead in the morning's National Herald that expressed the enormity of the challenge on the ill-defined mountainous borders. 'The nation is in peril. Defend it with all your might.' National Herald was Nehru's newspaper and these were Nehru's words, unusually positioned above the masthead to highlight the seriousness of the turn of events. Within the next couple of days - barring his sworn opponents - the nation was firmly standing behind the heartbroken prime minister.

I remember Amma going out with some women in our area to deposit jewellery in the government's coffers. The women were not warmongers, but Nehru had asked for their help, and so it had to be given.

Had Indian leaders been more forthcoming with the truth, there would perhaps be a more informed polity.

The metaphor of the gate to stop a foreign incursion was not Barrister Abbasi's monopoly. The current prime minister sees himself as the gatekeeper of the nation on different fronts. And it is clearly considered a lapse on Nehru's part too, that he didn't (or couldn't) keep India's gate securely fastened when the Chinese troops came calling.

Nations have settled their most intractable borders by choice but also by duress. Where to stop and how much to give and what to take instead is tricky. Usually, the higher the strategic advantage one seeks in the bargain the lower is the trust quotient in the quest.

On can construct an idea of nationhood around historical facts or around glorious and necessarily spurious myths. It seems a quirk of unalloyed history though that as a north Indian one shares the national flag with the culturally and linguistically distant Naga people but not with Nepalis where one might be more at home. Put this apparent national anomaly to a slice of colonial history.

It has been claimed by Hindutva nationalists, on the other hand, that Nepal wanted to become part of India in the 1950s and that Nehru turned down the offer over fears of appearing to be an expansionist soon after gaining independence. I'm not privy to the facts here. But we do know that land was swapped recently with Bangladesh, suddenly changing the fortunes and the nationalist loyalties of those who were thus affected by this give and take in the border enclave. Goa and Sikkim were not part of the Indian struggle for independence.

The Sikh empire made their Dogra chieftain of Jammu in-charge of Kashmir. The Dogras expanded their empire on behalf of the Sikh rulers right up to the sacred Manasarovar Lake, now in Tibet, thus giving access to trade in cashmere wool. Hindus from India travel to Manasarovar and Mount Kailash on annual pilgrimages but after securing visas from the Chinese embassy in Delhi. They didn't need this piece of paper earlier.

It just so happened that the Dogra army was marooned in the killing winter of the Tibetan plateau. The Tibetans counterattacked but were stalled before they could reach Leh. Where should we draw the boundary? The British didn't want Kashmir, much less any part of China or Tibet. They sought only to use both as independent buffers against a real or imagined southward expansion of the Russian empire, same quest as British adventures in Afghanistan.

The problem arises for charged-up nationalists while changing or demarcating the format of imaginary lines, which is what borders essentially are. In India's case, Hindu nationalists imbue the nation with a spiritual dimension in the form of Bharat Mata, her head rising in the region of Jammu and Kashmir. These folks are mostly unaware that the instrument of accession cited by India shows Hari Singh as the Jammu and Kashmir Naresh and Tibbat Desh Adhipati - effectively, a ruler of Jammu and Kashmir and Tibet. Are we to then lay claim to Tibet?

Had Indian leaders been more forthcoming with the truth, and were willing to share the facts on the ground with the people, there would perhaps be a more informed polity than the mindless cacophony offered on India's many TV channels.

Suppose the people were to be told as has been reliably claimed, that India's 'Iron Man' Sardar Patel had pressed for a trade-off with Pakistan, handing over Kashmir for a peaceful merger of the Nizam's Hyderabad to the new Indian state, would it lead to a better awareness of Indian history and of the events on the borders?

The current stand-off between India and China seems to have less to do with their border dispute, which stands as a dispute. The more informed Indian analysts do not see it as China's land grab at all. China sought India as a critical partner in its Belt and Road Initiative, which would directly link it to Central Asia, a great alternative to the circuitous Iran port route through Afghanistan. The Chinese were, however, listening to the debate in the Indian parliament over the annexation of Jammu and Kashmir last year. The home minister said Aksai Chin was part of India. And there's never a day when this or that TV channel doesn't speak of capturing Gilgit-Baltistan from Pakistan, critical to China. Is it possible the Chinese have moved to close the gate - to be able to enjoy their sundowners, as Barrister Abbasi once did?

A Chinese expert on international relations says the New Cold War triggered by coronavirus pandemic will be limited and may have positive impact on global health and governance.

Dr Hu Shisheng, Director, Institute for South Asian Studies, China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, was speaking at a webinar -- Can the world afford another Cold War -- organised by the Pakistan Institute of China Studies, University of Sargodha (UoS), as part of its summer webinar series, says press release issued here on Tuesday.

A distinguished panel which spoke on the issue largely agreed the perceived threat of rising China had put the US under an imperial fatigue.

Dr Hu Shisheng said China was focusing on strengthening its neighbouring countries. 'It is largely a source for low-cost consumer goods. Since it has grown into an increasingly high-tech economy, it has frustrated the US administration over growing imbalance in relationships.'

Chinese expert says US frustrated over growing imbalance in relationships

Dr Guo Xuetang, Director, Institute for International Strategy and Policy Analysis, Shanghai University, was of the view that the differences between the United States and China were stark and fundamental. 'They can barely be managed by negotiations and can never really be assuaged. The ideological confrontation will set the New World Order. India is trying to benefit from the US for its own ambitious agenda.'

He urged the world to work for `gross development peace' in every region.

Dr Filippo Boni, lecturer at the Department of Politics and International Studies, the Open University, UK, viewed current US posturing due to Trump regime agenda for election rant. He also believed even countries like India within US alliance don't share US vision and wish to advocate their own agenda.

'European approach is not a US centric. They are appreciative of BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) to some extent whereas the US will continue to adopt a negative way of defining Chinese model of development, especially by terming BRI and CPEC a debt trap,' Dr Boni said.

Dr Salma Malik from the Department of Defence and Strategic Studies, Quid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, discussed the aggressive approach of US towards China and the impact of push factor on developing countries, particularly the countries of South Asia and Africa.

She said China-US confrontation would affect developing countries militarily and economically. 'The great power rivalry can translate down into South Asia, which could be further played in Afghanistan, disrupting peace efforts and can fuel the proxy war,' she added.

UoS VC Dr Ishtiaq Ahmad also spoke.

OPERATION: The irrigation department and the district administration have decided to retrieve the state land worth millions of rupees along the bank of Lower Jhelum Canal before Eidul Azha.

It is pertinent to mention here that people have occupied land along the bank of the canal and constructed buildings illegally on it while residential colonies existing along the canal are disposing of sewage into the canal.

The metropolitan corporation failed to stop the farmers from growing vegetables through sewage.

The farmers are frequently using sewage for irrigation along the Lahore-Sargodha and Faisalabad-Sargodha roads with the connivance of employees of the metropolitan corporation.


 
 

Peace in Afghanistan will benefit the region: speakers

Peace process in Afghanistan should not be seen as a zero sum game, but as a much needed bid to restore peace as well as prosperity in the country and the region.

These were the views of most of the speakers at a special webinar on 'Afghan Peace Process: The Way Forward' organised by the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) on Wednesday.

Speakers included retired ambassadors Riaz Mohammad Khan, Ashraf Jehangir Qazi and Rustam Shah Mohmand.

It was unanimously agreed that the US-Taliban peace deal in February this year and President Ashraf Ghani giving Abdullah Abdullah a leading role in seeking peace with the Taliban and the authority to name half the cabinet were historic achievements.

Both offer hope for the much more challenging stage of the peace process in Afghanistan, the intra-Afghan dialogue between the Kabul government, various political factions and the Taliban.

Say complete withdrawal of the US was not on the table

The speakers were of the view that while the US might have arm-twisted both to sign the power-sharing deal to make the environment conducive for dialogue with the Taliban, it also addressed President Ghani's reservation of being pushed out of the loop in the Doha Agreement and putting him back into the heart of affairs along with Abdullah Abdullah.

All the speakers agreed that Taliban's capacity to control violence was questionable and so before the withdrawal, the US along with other regional leaders should define the minimum standard for devising a new governance framework of the country.

They were of the opinion that complete withdrawal of the US was not on the table. The US will likely have presence in Afghanistan to keep a close eye on China, and perhaps even support Indian interests in the region, which might keep them in confrontation with the Taliban, they said.

Ambassador Riaz Mohammad Khan discussed how this power sharing arrangement between two election opponents lucidly defined both their roles.

President Ghani will have undivided control over the office of the executive without having to deal with another defacto 'Prime Minister' and his powerplay, whereas Abdullah Abdullah, having a reputation for building consensus amongst different political groups, is saddled with leading the High Council for National Reconciliation (HCNR). Responsibilities are split based on the strengths of both politicians which is a good omen, Mr Khan said.

He also pointed out that while the Taliban have outlasted American military might, their test begins on the negotiating table. They have to prove themselves as more than a group of militant fundamentalists as they are still under international scrutiny. Moreover, the group needs to manifest that it has 'modernised' to the needs of the contemporary Afghanistan, he added.

According to Ambassador Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, the existential challenge of global warming, Covid-19 and its succeeding pandemics are likely to occur with shorter and shorter intervals and are likely to fatally distract and disable Afghanistan.

He called for a comprehensive 'green new deal' which would transform national policies, including foreign policies.

He warned that the success of such a peace settlement depends on the independence of the Afghan economy, China could very well include Afghanistan as a major building block in China's Belt and Road Initiative. In other words global powers as well as regional ones need to ramp up investment in the land-locked nation.

Rustam Shah Mohmand was of the view that the role of regional powers has been instrumental in the once considered elusive peace process in Afghanistan. The joint statement of representatives of Pakistan, China, Iran and Russia on May 18, 2020, shows the intent for an Afghan-led peace and reconciliation process.

All regional players will be beneficiaries of the peace deal. However, he warned that given the huge financial investments made by India in various sectors, it will continue to meddle in Afghan affairs, especially to destabilise Pakistan.

In his welcome and concluding remarks, Acting IPRI President retired Brig Raashid Wali Janjua said there was a consensus on the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan which was contingent on the outcome of the intra-Afghan dialogue.

All regional stakeholders need to be on board for withdrawal in an orderly fashion. One of the most important challenges is chalking out a power-sharing deal with the Taliban and the acceptability of that deal by all factions. The Afghan peace process needs to be inclusive and participatory with full support of the regional countries, he added.


 
 

Govt vows greater transparency in second phase of CPEC

The government on Thursday vowed greater transparency and lesser reliance on loans during the second phase of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

CPEC Authority Chairman and Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Information retired Lt Gen Asim Bajwa said the Phase-II of CPEC would be started after 'full preparation and in an institutional manner', while ensuring 'full transparency'.

He was speaking at the signing ceremony of business cooperation agreements between leading Chinese entrepreneurs and Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC) in Taxila for revamping of the facility.

Pakistan and China had agreed in April on the launching of the second phase of CPEC during Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to Beijing for attending a meeting of Belt and Road Forum.

The second phase was then envisioned to focus on development of Special Economic Zones, agriculture sector and socio-economic development.

The multi-billion-dollar joint Pak-China undertaking for infrastructure development was launched in 2015 during Chinese President Xi Jingping's visit to Islamabad. The Phase-I of the project was mostly about setting up of energy projects and developing road networks linking Gwadar Port with Kashgar.

Gen Bajwa said that all projects of Phase-I of CPEC held up or delayed because of procedural or technical issues would be completed on priority basis.

Eight power generation projects have been completed, which added nearly 6,000MW of electricity to the national grid, while another nine are in the pipeline.

The CPEC has faced criticism from the United States. American officials say its projects lack transparency and have added significantly to Pakistan's foreign loan burden. Both Islamabad and Beijing have strongly rejected US criticism as propaganda.

The Foreign Office, while rejecting US allegations, had earlier said that CPEC was transparently contributing to national development and issues in the execution of the project were bilaterally addressed by Beijing and Islamabad through existing mechanisms. It had further clarified that public debt relating to CPEC projects was less than 10 per cent of the total debt burden.

Gen Bajwa said reliance on loans would be decreased through promoting business-to-business ties between Chinese and Pakistani entrepreneurs in Phase-II.

'We are looking at foreign direct investment in the next phase, and foreign companies and entrepreneurs partnering with local investors and businessmen,' he said.


 
 

Pandemic disruption has elevated  BRI `s importance: former SBP governor

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) represents a very good opportunity for Pakistan to get out of its economic malaise, according to Yaseen Anwar, former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

The Salon themed `BRI and the World Economy amid Covid-19` was held last month by International Monetary Institution (IMI) aimed to probe into the impact of Covid-19 on the financial and economic landscape of the world, the China Economic Net reported.

According to the report, Mr Anwar in his keynote address at Salon, addressed perceived scepticism against CPEC. `If another country has an equal amount of resources to give to Pakistan to support these infrastructure projects, so be it. It`s a diversified opportunity for any country to come in and support the country in this effort,` he said.

`Due to the prevailing uncertainty from the coronavirus, severe disruption of the supply chain Belt and Road Initiative`s (BRI) importance has been elevated even more, said Mr Anwar.

He said the lack of quality infrastructure had hampered the economic development that many countries needed, and BRI gave access to capital to certain emerging economies that never had the opportunity to attract offshore investors who required ratings dictated by their corporate policies.

As per data presented by the former SBP governor, the shortage of power in Pakistan impaired its GDP growth rates by up to 3pc, the report stated.

The absence of a developed transportation network for refrigerator trucks for the distribution of agricultural products resulted in a 50pc loss of perishable products in Pakistan, it added. `Without power plant, the engine for manufacturing and other industries, Pakistan would continuously be played with a depressed state,` said Mr Anwar.

Therefore, he said, BRI`s finance for infrastructure projects in poor countries that do not have access to other bond markets was significant. According to the report, Mr Anwar said the investment would help boost urbanisation and help poor countries come up with the curve for income equality which has got a wide gap right now, and improve their livelihoods.

`The second area of increased importance tied to climate change is BRI`s emphasis and priority on the development, issuance and usage of the Belt and Road Inter-Bank Regular Cooperation Bonds (`BRBR` bond), Mr Anwar added.

He pointed out that the integration and intra-regional trade associated with BRI was going to pick up, and there were three main areas that would benefit from it, one being the Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region, another Africa, and the third central Asian republics with Pakistan and other countries in South Asia.

The intra-regional trade would gain momentum immensely by the infrastructure needs in the next couple of decades, said Mr Anwar. More than $60 billion of new business had been generated across a range of operations, including increased investment and tourism into Africa; new housing in Indonesia, power projects in Bangladesh; roads in Pakistan and Kazakhstan; and rising global and intra-regional trade across the Asean region, the report said.

India promoting Hinduism under garb of secularism: AJK president

Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) President Sardar Masood Khan on Saturday said after grudgingly accepting the independence of Pakistan, India adopted a secular doctrine.

This concept, he said, was an insincere attempt as this was nothing but Hinduism mascaraed as secularism.

He was speaking at two separate web-conferences organised by the Institute of Policy Studies on 'India: past, present and future: perceptions of the Muslim World', and by the Pakistan High Commission in UK on 'Seeking justice for Kashmiri victims of sexual violence and physical torture and widows'.

Speaking at the IPS session, Mr Khan said Hindu fascists romanticise an imaginary state of Akhand Bharat that they claim to have existed before the arrival of Muslim rulers in the subcontinent.

This notion, he said, is not only unsubstantiated by history but is also counter-intuitive, says a press release.

Referring to the faux secularism adopted by India, the AJK president said over decades this glue of secularism had come off and the real face of India's political masters been exposed.

'Not long after independence, on October 27, 1947, India began working on its imperialistic agenda, and invaded the Jammu and Kashmir State. Driven by its Hindu-extremist policy, India has carried on with this agenda over the years,' he said.

Mr Khan said lawmakers and the leadership of BJP, the RSS and their affiliates have publicly declared that they would do away with Muslims from within India.

This, he said, has caught the attention of Hindu zealots from across India which has consequently impacted the larger political landscape of India.

This BJP-RSS nexus has waged three wars in the region; one against its minorities inside its own borders, the second against Kashmiris in the occupied territory of Kashmir and the third one against all its neighbouring countries.

Considering Pakistan as the enemy number one, they have threatened to wipe off Pakistan from the face of the earth by the use of nuclear weapons, he maintained.

Mr Khan said India's ambition of becoming a colonial and imperial power in the region has led it to using the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh for sabotaging the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It has also formed a four-member alliance comprising India, US, Japan and Australia to oppose the BRI and, especially, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

'India is the biggest barrier for progress in the region. Saarc has been struggling for decades and that too because India has been standing in the way of economic integration as it wants to establish its hegemony in South Asia.'

Speaking about the situation in India-held Kashmir, he said India was practicing the policy of lebensraum by reoccupying the state of Jammu and Kashmir, bifurcating it and now bringing it under the direct rule of Delhi.

He compared the new domicile rules introduced in held Kashmir to the policy followed by Nazi Germany against the Jews based initially on economic strangulation followed by demonisation and marginalisation and finally physical extermination.

Speaking at the web conference hosted by the Pakistan High Commission in United Kingdom, the AJK president appealed to powerful nations to make moral and legal choices for bringing India to justice and helping dismantle this machine of torture in the held Kashmir.

'Silence is a crime when such torture is openly taking place in any part of the world,' he said.

He added that 25,000 Hindus from all over India have been given domiciles of held Kashmir, and in the same manner in which Muslim Indians have become second class citizens, Kashmiris have to run from pillar to post just to prove that they are state subjects.

'If we don't stop this now IOJK won't be a recognisable entity like it is today. Two million Hindus will be brought in over the coming years,' he said.

The AJK president said India's non-permanent seat in the UN Security Council will lead to three setbacks in the council.

Firstly, it will try to delete the agenda from the UNSC calendar; secondly, they would make efforts to stop us from holding informal meetings on Kashmir; and thirdly, they will imperil funding of the mandate of the UNMOGIP.

'As a permanent member of the UNSC, UK can stop this and create a balance in the UNSC,' he added.


 
 

Pakistan warns about 'spoilers' of Afghan peace process

Pakistan on Wednesday warned about 'spoilers' trying to undermine the peace process in Afghanistan as efforts for kick-starting the long-elusive intra-Afghan dialogue continue.

'Afghan peace process has entered a critical phase. We, therefore, need to remain alert to the elements, who are attempting to sabotage the progress,' Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told US Special Envoy for Afghan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad.

Mr Khalilzad, accompanied by his delegation, reached here from Tashkent (Uzbekistan), as part of his three-nation trip that will also include Doha (Qatar). In Tashkent, the special envoy met foreign ministers from five Central Asian States - Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic - under the C5+1 dialogue format to urge them support the Afghan peace efforts.

Mr Qureshi, while reaffirming Pakistan's continued support for peace efforts, said: 'Pakistan remains committed to working with international and regional stakeholders for sustainable, peaceful, and political resolution of the Afghan dispute.'

The foreign minister welcomed the readiness of both Afghan government and the Taliban for participation in the intra-Afghan dialogue and announcement of their negotiation teams. He said the dialogue would pave the way for lasting peace in the war-ravaged country that has been in conflict for decades.

Qureshi in meeting with Khalilzad urges 'all sides' to reduce violence

The Afghan government and the Taliban have also agreed on Doha as the venue for their talks. However, the delay in the release of prisoners has been holding up the start of the negotiations, which were originally scheduled to commence on March 10 following the signing of Doha Accord between the US and the insurgent group.

Afghan authorities, as per the agreement, were to release 5,000 insurgency fighters, while the Taliban were to set free 1,000 Afghan forces men in their custody. Kabul claims to have released 4,000 Taliban and the Taliban say they have freed about 700 government soldiers. There are, however, differences between the two sides over the numbers.

Head of Taliban Political Office Mullah Baradar, in a video conference with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday night, said the delay in the start of negotiations was because of slow process of releasing the detainees, and the establishment of security points by government security forces.

Another sticking point is the heightened violence. The Taliban say their fighters conducted 'operations' against Afghan forces trespassing the areas held by them, otherwise they have abided by the understating on lowering violence by not attacking major cities and military installations.

Mr Qureshi expressed the hope that release of prisoners would be completed soon. He further urged 'all sides' to reduce violence.

There have been questions about high-profile assassinations and attacks in and around Kabul, including the June 23 killing of Afghan prosecutors and government employees, and the bombing of a vehicle carrying human rights activist Fatima Khalil on June 27.

These attacks have not been claimed by any group. Amb Khalilzad had after the killing of the prosecutors tweeted: 'This attack underscores what we all know: Spoilers (both domestic and foreign) are trying to disrupt and delay.'

Mr Qureshi, in his meeting, re-emphasised the need for being alert to the sinister designs of the 'spoilers'.

Mr Khalilzad is being accompanied on this trip by Chief Executive Office of US International Development Finance Corporation (USDFC) Adam Boehler. He is pushing Trump administration's plans for increased regional connectivity, trade and development.

The USDFC was set up in 2018 for American investments in development projects in low- and middle-income countries around the world. Many suspect it to have been set up for countering China's Belt and Road Initiative and its flagship project China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Nothing was said in the Foreign Office's media statement about what is being offered by the USDFC.


 
 

FO welcomes IDFC's plans to invest in Pakistan

The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday welcomed the United States International Development Finance Corporation's (IDFC) plans to invest in Pakistan, saying this would benefit the region.

Speaking at the FO's weekly press briefing, spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said: 'The meeting between Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce and Investment Mr Abdul Razak Dawood and the chief executive officer of U.S. International Development Finance Corporation Mr Adam Boehler … would further strengthen efforts in concretising important development projects benefitting both Pakistan and Afghanistan and the region as a whole.'

Mr Boehler visited Pakistan with US Special Envoy for Afghan Reconciliation Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad on Wednesday.

In a separate statement, the US Embassy said that during his meetings in Islamabad, Mr Boehler discussed investment opportunities to strengthen Pakistan's economy and contribute to peace and stability in the region.

The US had launched the IDFC in 2018 to rival China's Belt and Road Initiative. The idea was to counter what was seen in Washington as China's aggressive overseas development policies by co-investing with US and non-US private sector companies in infrastructure projects in countries that were part of China's BRI programme.

Washington has also been critical of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). US officials allege that CPEC lacks transparency and is adding to Pakistan's debt burden. Islamabad rejects these allegations.

When asked if Pakistan too sees the IDFC as a rival to the BRI and CPEC, Ms Farooqui referred to the statement issued by the Ministry of Commerce, which said that Mr Dawood desired stronger connectivity with Central Asian republics through road networks and power infrastructure.

Mr Dawood told Mr Boehler that the Pakistani government assures a level playing field for investors from all over the world, irrespective of their country of origin.

While discussing the Sopore incident, in which a civilian was killed by Indian forces and an image of his grandson sitting by the body went viral on mainstream and social media, Ms Farooqui said: 'The heart wrenching picture of the three year old boy in Sopore will forever remain seared in the imagination of all those who believe in humanity, human rights and fundamental freedoms.'

She added: 'India cannot wash away the truth by fake news and turning its propaganda machinery faster.'

Ms Farooqui said ceasefire violations by Indian security forces continue unabated along the Line of Control (LoC).

'As a result of recent violations and mortar and artillery shelling on the LoC in Kayani and Jura sectors of the LoC, on 29th and 30th June 2020, 16-year-old Mohammad Tauheed, resident of Talwari village, embraced shahadat.'

She said Indian troops have committed 1,546 ceasefire violations in the first six months of this year, resulting in the martyrdom of 14 and serious injuries to 114 innocent civilians.

Eminent speakers have shed light on the current uncertain geopolitical situation that exists between India and China and its effects on the region at a webinar titled 'India China standoff at Ladakh and its impact on Kashmir'.

The event was organised by the Karachi Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday evening.

Azad Jammu and Kashmir President Sardar Masood Khan said the immediate trigger for the situation in Ladakh was India's expansionism and the steps it took on Aug 5, 2019 and April 2 this year to change its demographic composition reducing the Muslim majority to a minority. Last year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had threatened Azad Kashmir. So this was a direct threat to China and Pakistan.

China took a proactive stance by taking the issue of Jammu and Kashmir to the Security Council after a gap of 50 years. Later this year, the situation in Ladakh deteriorated along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and China took a very firm and robust stand to defend its sovereignty, he said.

He said India was targeting the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). China was attentive to the developments; when India took steps to infringe the LAC, it was met with a firm response. The second thing was the rise of Hindutva, which believed in expansionism - it's the doctrine behind all these aggressive moves and against China. The US was using India as a pawn in the South Asian and South East Asia chessboard. India falsely promised to Washington that it would perform that role but did not get its act together in doing its bidding. 'Obviously, the BRI and CPEC are India's targets.'

President Khan said another factor was that China rightly felt that India was assisting the US to encircle China. The bigger agenda was to contain China. A few years back, the president of China had proposed to then US president Barack Obama, and subsequently to Donald Trump, that they didn't have to go to war, presenting a model of cooperation rather than confrontation. The US decision-makers had been sceptical about the proposal. The atmosphere between the two became more vitiated and India wanted to take advantage of it, he added.

He pointed out that despite India's high expectation, the US would now or in the future not be able to bail it out vis-à-vis China. The US did provide them with some satellite imagery but they didn't share with India their national intelligence estimates about China's deployment. 'India is at war with its neighbours and has declared war on its own citizens, particularly Muslims,' he said.

On the situation's impact on Kashmir, the AJK president said India for the past 72 years had been trying to give the impression to the rest of the world that it's a domestic issue but the 'developments in recent past have further internationalised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and it has been seen as a geopolitical flashpoint. There is a serious possibility of a false flag operation.'

When the rest of the world was watching Ladakh they were also talking about three nuclear powers and the possibility of a clash of a nuclear level. Against this backdrop, he underlined, 'we should strengthen Pak-China relations. Pakistan and China have been doing joint exercise and we need to invest more in these exercises. We have to increase the number of allies. China has so many allies all over the world; Pakistan should also expand its number of friends.

'We should prepare for a war because India's agenda is aggressive and destabilising. We should take no chances. Together Pakistan and China need to be vigilant. Hindutva is an existential threat for Pakistan, and to all South Asians and other neighbours,' he said.

'A die-hard Hindutva ideologue'

Earlier, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed said Ladakh was a crisis of Mr Modi's making. He made the same miscalculation that Nehru made who had the same imperialist mindset in 1962 vis-à-vis China and got a thrashing. It all started on Aug 5, 2019 when India announced the annexation of Kashmir and Ladakh, and declared them union territory. China's foreign ministry said it's unacceptable. On Aug 6, Amit Shah announced that Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Aksai Chin were integral parts of India and they would die fighting to get them back. The statement was repeated by India's chief of army staff and defence minister, he said.

Senator Syed said it's important we did not repeat old mistakes. 'We misread Modi. He is a die-hard Hindutva ideologue.'

He added India had launched a hybrid war. We saw that at Karachi Stock Exchange and saw it in Ghotki and Larkana. 'We should get ready for covert operations,' he said, adding: 'We had ignored the region in terms of foreign policy. Pakistan's foreign policy needed a revamp. We must try and prevent a new cold war from coming to our part of the world.'

Ambassador Mustafa Kamal Kazi said contrary to Modi's address to his nation the fact that 20 Indian soldiers died was actually a result of an attack on the Chinese posts; it was an act of aggression. The Chinese gave them a befitting reply. Claims of past records by India were a lie. India suffered a humiliating defeat in 1962. After the 1962 war China as a goodwill gesture withdrew its forces from advanced positions with the understanding that the area vacated would not be occupied by the other side. Sine 1993 India and China had signed five agreements on peace but with Modi's rise to power India built up threatening military infrastructure and constructed a road in the disputed border region. 'It's a clear violation of all agreements,' he said.

The Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) on Tuesday urged the government to accelerate work on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) special economic zones (SEZs).

In a statement, RCCI President Saboor Malik said the industrial parks would be developed aligned with local available resources.

He said Covid-19 had affected the national economy on many fronts. However, keeping in view the package announced for the construction industry by the government, there is a big opportunity to kick start trade activities via SEZs. Unemployment can only be addressed if the private sector be given more incentives and engagements, he further added.

The RCCI president said: 'We recognize CPEC as a game changer and we urge the government to focus on the 4th part of CPEC plan, which is Industrial Zones Development.'

He further said that the CPEC is the flagship project of multi-billion dollar One belt one road and the success of this key mega project will bring the economic revolution in the country and the region.

He said Pakistan's economy offered great potential to Chinese investors for joint ventures and investments.


 
 

The right to rule

AMONG the first things senior military commanders are taught is never to fight on two fronts.

Hitler and his Nazis learned this the hard way by attacking the Soviet Union while the German army was engaged in the West. Although the USSR lost over 25 million lives, the effort bled the Germans white, and led to their defeat.

In Germany's case, it was Nazi ideology and Hitler's hubris that drove the Panzers towards Moscow. Today, it is largely Trump's mantra of 'Make America Great Again', combined with a right-wing belief in American supremacy, that has pushed the country into a pointless feud with China.

This is not to imply that a shooting war is around the corner, or that China is entirely blameless in this conflict. But basically, as the ban on Huawei demonstrates, the Americans are terrified of losing their technological edge. So to hold China back while they catch up, they are using their diplomatic clout to force compliant countries like the UK to fall into line.

If Trump is re-elected, US-China tensions can be expected to rise.

China, for its part, has refused to kowtow before American pressure, and has thus far mostly matched American sanctions in the trade war. But its actions to claim sovereignty over parts of the South China Sea has caused alarm across the region, and lost it friends like Vietnam, Myanmar and the Philippines. South Korea and Japan are now reviewing their defence postures against what they see as a resurgent China.

On the remote, mountainous Indo-Chinese border, the recent clashes show a willingness on both sides to use whatever it takes to keep the bits of that useless land they already have. Fortunately, good sense has prevailed in Beijing where the leadership seems to have realised that it had opened too many fronts, and the one with India could be moved to the back burner without losing much face.

When the opening up of the Chinese economy began under Deng Xiaoping, the new post-Mao leadership realised that despite Mao's rhetoric, the economic and military imbalance between China and America was too great for an open confrontation. Their long-term strategy was therefore to achieve economic strength that would lead to acquiring modern military capability.

Until Xi Jinping's elevation to the presidency, China's immediate ambitions were relatively modest, focusing on the economy, cutting-edge technology, modern armaments and training. But increasingly, its naval and aerial patrols began challenging US ships and planes that approached its coast.

Now, following Trump's election, and his sabre-rattling over trade, Xi has stood his ground and exchanged duty hike for duty hike. However, China's brutal treatment of the Uighur Muslims and its crackdown on Hong Kong protesters is helping America forge an anti-China front. The emergence of Covid-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and Beijing's mishandling of the early information about the disease, didn't help varnish China's image either.

President Xi's visionary Belt and Road Initiative has been suffering from delays and charges of extortionate rates on loans, as well as allegedly corrupt practices by local and Chinese investors. All these factors have combined to transform China into the bad guy; luckily for Xi, Trump's behaviour has moved the focus of some of this acrimony to Washington.

But while there have been protests and editorials in the West against the inhumane incarceration of up to a million Uighurs in Xinjiang province, the Muslim world has been shamefully silent. Had this happened to a group of Muslims in the West, you can bet there would be violent protests every day. But by staying out of the internal affairs of usually harsh Muslim regi­mes, and selling them arms with no questions asked about human rights violations, China has earned a get-out-of-jail card from most of them.

If Trump gets re-elected, we can expect tensions to escalate with the real possibility of the ongoing cold war turning into an armed conflict. Four more years of Trump are too awful to contemplate. And even if Biden gets into the White House, don't expect a U-turn: both countries are carrying too much baggage at this point to back off.

I often ask English critics of the curtailment of freedom in Hong Kong how much democracy was permitted in the colony when Britain was ruling it in the last century. The fact is that far worse human rights violations have happened in ex-British colonies in the recent past without drawing the kind of protests we are seeing against the Chinese treatment of violent Hong Kong demonstrators.

There's a general feeling in much of Europe and America that China's rise is upsetting the 'natural order of things'. In fact, these were the words used by an English politician who was castigated for racism recently. However, said or unsaid, this is the sentiment in even liberal circles who seem to feel that somehow, the white races have a God-given right to call the shots. So China's rise is generally welcomed by non-white countries.


 
 

The lukewarm war

WHEN the Iran-India deal on Chabahar port was announced in 2016, it sent considerable shockwaves through strategic circles in Pakistan, and rightly so. Viewed as part of India's encirclement strategy, Chabahar was seen not only as a potential rival to Gwadar, but also as an indication of India's widening regional influence and as a potential outpost for India on Pakistan's western flank.

Taking a wider-angle look, it also had the potential to cut off Pakistan from Afghan trade as the project, and the accompanying rail link from Chabahar to Zahedan and then on to Zaranj in Afghanistan could eventually have, if not exactly replaced, but at least curtailed Afghan transit trade through Pakistan.

A year later, the capture of India spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, who also operated out of Chabahar, added to these anxieties given that it was unlikely at best that his anti-Pakistan activities were not known to, and tolerated by, Iranian authorities. The noose was tightening and strangulation seemed inevitable with an openly hostile India to the east, a nearly equally hostile Afghanistan - considered to be heavily influenced by India - to the west and now Iran seemingly joining in.

But a lot can change in four years, and recently there were reports that Iran had decided to cut India out of the railway project and go it alone. Quoting sources in the Iranian government, media reports claimed that this was due to India's reluctance to initiate their part of this project in the light of its increasing bonhomie with the US and also the related fear of sanctions, even though Chabahar had been given a special waiver by the United States.

America's belligerent attitude has pushed Iran into the Chinese orbit.

Adding to this was a statement by Mohammad Ali Hosseini, the Iranian ambassador to Pakistan, which seemed to obliquely refer to India by mentioning 'foreign governments found reluctant in their relations with Iran and need others' permission for their even normal interactions, for sure they won't be capable of planning and implementing such long-term cooperation contracts'.

Subsequently, there came a statement from a deputy to Iran's ports and maritime organisation, Farhad Montaser, saying that India had never been a part of such a deal and that sanctions had nothing to do with Iran and India's cooperation in Chabahar. But while such diplomatic signalling and denials are par for the course, it is very clear that the regional picture is changing to India's detriment.

And as far as Iran is concerned, this has less to do with a railway and more to do with a comprehensive deal signed with China. Described as a 'sweeping economic and security partnership', the deal is said to encompass $400 billion dollars of investments and entails cooperation in the military sphere as well.

Following this, there have been several statements from Iran in support of the Belt and Road Initiative and CPEC, with Hosseini even talking about linking Gwadar and Chabahar to China by rail and conjuring up visions of a 'golden ring' of China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan.

While the Iran-China deal is said to have been on the cards since 2016, it is clear that it is America's belligerent attitude towards Iran that has now pushed Iran further into the Chinese orbit, and the corollary effect will likely be a corresponding decrease in Indian influence in Iran. That, in turn, will result in a reduction of the pressure on Pakistan, as hyperbole aside, Chinese involvement in Iran is a net gain for Pakistan, not only because it reduces Indian influence in the post-Galwan world, but also makes Iran a potential partner with a vested interest in Pakistan's security and reduces the chances of Tehran being a potential adversary.

As for Chinese ingresses into the subcontinent, New Delhi has its own intransigence, and insistence on refracting foreign policy through the prism of domestic political considerations governed by a narrow supremacist ideology. For further proof of that, look no further than Nepal which is being pushed further and further into the Chinese orbit in large part thanks to India's bullying attitude.

This, the developments in Iran and the all-too recent humiliation at the hands of China in Galwan, will of course push India closer to the US which has in recent weeks upped its rhetoric against China, and has sent aircraft carriers to the South China Sea for the second time this month in a clear show of force aimed at deterring Beijing and boosting the morale of US allies in the region. Coupled with the US reaction to Hong Kong's new security law and the actions taken against Huawei, first by America and now by the UK, we can see the lines being drawn once again and the beginning of what looks like a new Cold War, with much of the world divided into competing camps whether by design or, in our case, by default.


 
 

Changing dynamics

THE geopolitical calculus in Pakistan's immediate neighbourhood is clearly changing, and those who formulate this country's foreign policy must plan now to ensure we are comfortably placed to take political and economic advantage of the emerging scenario.

Over the past few days, reports have emerged of a 25-year strategic bilateral deal involving China and Iran being hammered out between the two sides; the deal is said to cover both economic and military aspects.

Moreover, relations between the US and China seem to be going into a deep freeze, with some talking of a new 'cold war' between Washington and Beijing. The US has ordered the Chinese consulate in Houston to close in order to 'protect American intellectual property', with China slamming the move as 'outrageous'. Moreover, on a recent trip to the UK, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for building a 'global coalition' against the People's Republic.

Considering Pakistan shares borders with both Iran and China, and has had a long, chequered relationship with the US, Islamabad will need to play its cards right to protect national interests on the highly treacherous international chessboard.

The Iran-China deal - said to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars - offers an opportunity to Pakistan. While Pakistan enjoys cordial relations with China, this can be a good occasion to improve relations with Iran. China seeks to build a 21st-century Silk Road in the form of the Belt and Road Initiative, envisioning a global network of trade routes emanating from Beijing. It is in this context that it seeks to cement a deal with Iran, while CPEC is also a product of the same strategic thinking.

On the other hand, Tehran - struggling to stay afloat under crushing US-led sanctions - will gladly accept foreign investment, as well as a chance to sell its oil and gas. Pakistan can play a positive role in this budding relationship, with a chance at becoming a key conduit in an energy and trade corridor linking the Eurasian hinterland to South Asian and Gulf ports.

But there is a catch. As stated above, the US is in a combative mood vis-à-vis China, while Iran has been Washington's bête noire for over four decades. America has already spoken in unflattering terms about CPEC, while it is widely believed India has backed out of Iranian projects in order to avoid enraging Washington.

To take advantage of regional developments, Pakistan will need some deft diplomacy. Regional integration can help this country and its neighbours economically and politically if proper planning is done. The US must be told that while Pakistan values its relationship with America, Islamabad cannot isolate itself regionally by alienating neighbours with whom Washington does not get on.

India should also weigh its options; does it want to chase the fantasy of becoming a US 'strategic partner'? Or would it rather live in peace and prosperity with its neighbours?

China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects have not only remained unscathed by the Covid-19 pandemic but Pak-China bilateral cooperation has increased during this period, officials and think tank representatives said on Thursday.

They were speaking at a webinar on 'New Oppor­tunities and Challenges of China-Pakistan Cooperation in the Post-Epidemic Era', which was participated in by experts of Chinese and Pakistani think tanks. The webinar was organised by Pakistan-China Institute.

Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing spoke about the cooperation between the two countries during the pandemic and said his country's assistance for Pakistan was worth $15 million. Equipment and experts were flown to Pakistan since the outbreak of the disease here through 10 chartered flights, he said, adding that about 1000 more ventilators are expected to be delivered by the end of the month.

About CPEC, he said, over 60,000 Pakistanis had been employed with CPEC projects. He said 13,000 Chinese technicians, engineers and experts were also working on these projects.

Chief of China Overseas Ports Holding Company Zhang Baozhong said neither any Pakistani employee in any CPEC project had been laid off nor anyone has suffered a pay cut during the coronavirus crisis.

He said all CPEC projects were free of Covid-19.

Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chairman of the PCI Senator Mushahid Hussain said the silver-lining amid coronavirus crisis was the strengthening of Pak-China bilateral relations.

He said the time had come to reset our priorities and focus on human security, human development, better health care and climate change and in this regard, Belt and Road Initiative could be taken as a guiding tool to reach the goal of a shared future.

Dr Baige Zhao, former Population Minister and head of Research and Development International (RDI), in her opening remarks said that President Xi Jinping's speech about improving connectivity through BRI at last month's high-level video conference showed the will of China to start a new era of globalisation. The BRI, she said, would play a key role in promoting peace and stability in the world.

Executive Director of PCI Mustafa Hyder Sayed said the recent shift in Iran's policy with regard to CPEC was a good omen for regional connectivity.

He also called for developing skills of labour working on SEZs and emphasised the role that the private sector should play in the development of BRI.


 
 

'CPEC is becoming more and more comprehensive'

Speakers shed light on the salient features of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor at a webinar titled 'CPEC and its impact on the region'.

The event was organised by the Karachi Council on Foreign Relations (KCFR) on Thursday.

CPEC Authority chairman retired Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa said the subject was very dear to the heart of every Pakistan. 'CPEC is a transformational project, a game changer for Pakistan. The environment in the region is improving by the day, Pakistan is becoming the centre of all the development, and peace and prosperity is becoming visible in our lifetime. We have to take advantage of this.'

He said CPEC was planned in three phases. The first was meant to fill the gaps in our infrastructure in communication and energy.

Giving example of the roads, the eastern route from Peshawar to Karachi, he said: 'We've just completed the Multan to Sukkur motorway. Now one section of that road is left, which is Sukkur to Hyderabad. Similarly, hard work on the western route is going on. The western route mostly passes through remote areas which can uplift the economy of those areas and it will be great in order to mobilise all logistics from China to Pakistan.'

President Alvi says a desalination plant will soon be installed in Gwadar to cater to its water needs

Mentioning the priority areas in the second phase, he said the focus was on mass industrialisation through special economic zones.

There are a total of nine zones to be built and they're working on three prioritised zones - Rashakai, Faisalabad and Dhabeji - adding one more in Balochistan.

On agriculture, he said the focus was on three things: enhancing the yield of our agriculture, induction of technology and water conservation and farm management.

Then there is the area of science and technology for which they're working with the ministry of science and technology.

Mr Bajwa said: 'We are taking CPEC into the tourism sector. It is one area we have a lot [of] potential but suffering because of a lack of system and infrastructure.'

China praises Pakistan's cooperation

Ambassador of People's Republic of China to Pakistan Yao Jing said the Chinese government and its people appreciated the solidarity, support and assistance from the Pakistani government and its people when China was suffering from the coronavirus outbreak.

Just in the morning, he had discussed with the president of Pakistan the next stage of collaboration in fighting the pandemic. In the wake of the virus, several changes have come about, first of which is its effect on global economy.

'China is working hard to revive its economy. The Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan and his government are also doing a lot to revive the economy. With CPEC they're trying to adapt [to the change]. Several projects, especially in the area of construction, have started. The prime minister of Pakistan made it clear that the construction sector is the key to the revival of the economy.'

Mr Yao said they're going to shift more resources to meet challenges of the prevention and control of the coronavirus cases, doing more for the medical sector.

Then there is cooperation between the two countries in the industrial sector, in science and technology, tourism and water resources management.

'We are in close collaboration with various departments and ministries of the Pakistani government,' he said, adding that the fundamental of the economy was based on manufacturing and production, so they're going to help increase manufacturing and production capacities of Pakistani exporters.

The ambassador said internationally, a lot of developments happened during the pandemic, but the basic concept of CPEC was cooperation. 'It's a platform first between China and Pakistan. There are regional opportunities to offer for the regional countries as well. The task for China and Pakistan is that we do our best in regional and international cooperation platforms. CPEC is becoming more and more comprehensive, moving from economic to social sectors, from government cooperation to people-to-people cooperation.'

As far as the Chinese government is concerned, we are devoted to this project, he assured the hosts.

'$62bn CPEC project keeps on expanding'

President Arif Alvi in his plenary address said in the [history of] the world, peace was always related to the fact that there were trade routes. China and Pakistan had a great Silk Road which was re-established. As long as there's movement of goods, there's prosperity and trade between regions. One country more prosperous is able to import goods to less prosperous regions. Therefore, the BRI initiative of China is very important.

He said he's glad that CPEC had made a lot of progress. It's a $62 billion project which keeps on expanding as the need for communication through rail, fibre, energy, etc, and such routes become more popularised. We will have to keep increasing that infrastructure, he insisted.

As peace returns to Afghanistan, the president pointed out, it's very important that trade takes place from Gwadar.

With peace progressing in Afghanistan, the contribution of China and Pakistan to rebuilding Afghanistan and CPEC will play an important part. 'In the CPEC corridor 19 projects have been completed, about 28 are in the phase of implementation and 41 in the pipeline. And this will keep getting bigger and bigger.'

President Alvi said Gwadar is the crown jewel of the CPEC corridor because it links us to the Chinese north-western region as well as to Central Asia. As Gwadar expands and industries are set up, we need desalination plants. So 'a desalination plant is also in the process'.

He then went on to highlight the cooperation between China and Pakistan in other areas, particularly those from where Pakistan has learnt from China.

KCFR chairman Ikram Sehgal thanked the guests for their participation in the webinar, which was moderated by Aleena Agha.
