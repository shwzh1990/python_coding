# Data Analysis

## Back Ground
When doing the device test, it always takes about several day to run the test and generate the file called "log file". The log file present the device status during the test period. However, it is quite hard to analysis the massive info in the log, so using the python code to analysis the log is a must.


## Requirement:  
1. There are four devices needs to be tested. VT101 SI200 VT102 and RE400. But not need to test all the device at the same test. You have to check which device is under the test  
2. Each device have the same test cases you need to collect all the test case for each device  
3. you need to make a table at last to check how many time the test cases successed or failed
4. make a markdown file and convert it to PDF and then send the email to manager.
